They cross the vast continent of Antarctica, a frozen area that surrounds the South Pole. The penguins leave their ocean homes and cross the ice on a dangerous trip. They are blinded by blizzards and toppled over by strong winds. But each winter, they do this to lay their eggs and raise their chicks.\nThat cycle of life may be in trouble though. Scientists have discovered an alarming rise in temperatures around Antarctica. "The region at the peninsula has warmed up about 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 40 to 50 years," Wayne Trivelpiece, a scientist who studies Antarctica, told Weekly Reader.\nA recent study also shows that the ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed since the 1960s.

A loss of penguins could leave leopard seals and whales hungry. (See\n.) "A very small change in temperature [can] completely change the whole food chain," says Trivelpiece.\nItâ€™s not just emperor penguins and other creatures that may be in trouble. People who live thousands of miles away may be affected by melting ice.\nAs glaciers and sheets of ice melt, they add to the worldâ€™s sea level.

Why?\nJonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.\nFrom the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Rooseveltâ€™s death, Salkâ€™s vaccine was declared officially safe.\nIn October 2005Ñfor the first time in 26 years in the United StatesÑfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnâ€™t at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

It is topped only by Kingda Ka.\nThe world\'s newest roller coaster is one wild ride.\nAs you wait in line, you hear the screams of people riding Kingda Ka. Part of you can\'t wait to ride the roller coaster; another part of you wants to bolt in the opposite direction. Before you know it, it\'s your turn to board. You brace yourself.\n! With a roaring blast, the thrill ride rockets from 0 to 128 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. Before you can catch your breath, the train whisks you straight up 456 feet. When it can go no farther,\nplummets the coaster downward into a dizzying spiral twist. The train then whips you through another valley and zooms up another hill.\nCongratulations! You have just experienced the fastestÑand tallestÑroller coaster on Earth.\nKingda Ka, or the "King of Coasters," opens this spring at the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in Jackson, New Jersey. The jaw-dropping thrill ride shatters the world\'s record for roller coaster speed and height. Of the more than 1,000 roller coasters in the United States, it is the latest "extreme" coaster to be built.\nSix Flags roller coaster designer Larry Chickola says building Kingda Ka wasn\'t easy. "We considered the wind strength, the possibility of earthquakes, the weight of Kingda Ka itself, as well as the forces caused by launching a [coaster faster than one] has ever gone," he told\nenable roller coasters like Kingda Ka to move for most of the ride. According to scientists, energy is the ability to cause change. At the beginning of the ride, Kingda Ka blasts passengers to a speed of 128 miles an hour with technology similar to the kind that launches Navy jets from aircraft carriers. Each train on Kingda Ka is hooked up to a\ncable. Liquid under high pressure is pushed through the cable. Along with motors, the hydraulic power rockets the coaster skyward.\nAfter reaching the top of the first hill, the coaster works in the same way your bike does when you roll, pedal-free, down a slope. When a roller coaster is stopped, it has\n, or stored energy. At any moment, the coaster can move, so it has the potential for motion.\nAs the roller coaster starts cruising, gravity takes over and converts the potential energy into\n, which is the energy of motion. The repeated changes of potential energy to kinetic energy and then back again drives the roller coaster.\nKingda Ka covers 3,118 feet of track and lasts less than a minute. To roller coaster buff Steve Urbanowicz from New Jersey, the new ride is a scream! "The ride seems like it\'s over really quickly, but Kingda Ka packs eight high moments of drama into those 50 seconds," he told\nUrbanowicz, 46, speaks from experience. He has ridden 876 roller coasters around the world. In fact, he has taken more than 5,000 rides on one in particularÑthe wooden Cyclone at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where the first true American coaster opened in 1884.

Two new presidential museums are using the cutting edge of technology to tell the stories of past U.S. presidents.\nA group of students from nearby Rockledge Elementary School recently took a trip to Washington\'s home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. There, they saw a lifelike statue of Washington mounted on his horse during the Revolutionary War (1775Ñ1783). The statue is an exhibit in a new museum at Mount Vernon.\n"It was cool!" 10-year-old Jack Eghtessad from Woodbridge, Virginia, told\ndescribing the statue. "It didn\'t look fake."\nAt the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, students from the city\'s Iles Elementary School gasped. Lincoln\'s ghost appeared before them in the museum\'s library. "I felt like I was really seeing Lincoln," exclaimed Samantha Mackey, 11.\nor changing, the way kids learn about presidents. Recently, historians have started using more special effects to tell the stories of famous leaders. The new Mount Vernon museum has been open for only four months, but already it has drawn more than 90,000 visitors. February 19 will be the first Presidents\' Day it is open.\nExperts used paintings, historical documents, and the latest digital technology to create three statues of Washington for Mount Vernon. One of the statues shows Washington at age 19. Another statue depicts him at age 45, leading the Continental Army in the fight for\nor freedom, against the British. The third shows him at 57, when he became the first U.S. president. (See\nThe museum is also home to a special-effects theater that plays a\nor true-to-life movie, about Washington\'s life. As the film plays, the theater\'s seats rumble with the cannon fire of major battles. Fake snow even falls from the ceiling as the film shows Washington crossing the Delaware River in a surprise attack on the British military in 1776.\n"We are, in a way, definitely on the cutting edge," says Ann Bay, the Mount Vernon museum\'s educational director. "We were inspired by the Lincoln museum."\nSpringfield\'s Lincoln museum reopened with new special-effects exhibits in 2005. Since then the museum has averaged more than 12,000 visitors a week. Visitors can see a life-size re-creation of Lincoln and his family, use interactive computer stations, and tour the "ghost library."\nmake it look as if ghosts of Lincoln and other historical figures appear in the room. Lincoln historian Thomas Schwartz told\nthat the special effects draw students into Lincoln\'s story. In one exhibit, visitors watch as an electronic ticker counts the more than 618,000 Americans who were killed while Lincoln was president during the Civil War (1861Ñ1865). They see Lincoln\'s sad reaction to the huge death toll.\n"These are real people that had real tragedy, real joy, and real emotion in their lives. People need to understand that," Schwartz says. He thinks that special effects help get that point across to visitors.\nThis life-size model of Washington at age 19 gives visitors a glimpse of the first U.S. president in his youth. Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family. His first job was mapping out land. He then joined the British army and fought in the French and Indian War (1754Ñ1763). During the Revolutionary War (1775Ñ1783), he led the Continental Army against the British to win American independence. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States.\nUnlike Washington, Lincoln did not have enough money to pay for school. This wax statue shows Lincoln teaching himself by reading between chores. He went on to become a successful lawyer, and in 1860 he was elected the 16th U.S. president. He led the country during the Civil War (1861Ñ1865) between the states in the North and the South. Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in 1863.

At that time, the South was\nby law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.\nThose laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for\n, or equal rights under the law.\nRosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery\n. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks\'s courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.\nSCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955\nRosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.\nAt the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the "colored" section.\nAfter the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the "whites-only" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.\nThere are white people who want to sit down.\nYou know white people and black people can\'t sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?\nThen I\'m going to have you arrested.\nA few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.\nDid the driver tell you to stand?\nWhy do you all push us around?\nI don\'t know, but the law is the law, and you\'re under arrest.\nSCENE 2: Rosa Parks\'s house, that night\nRosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.\nFor years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottÑand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery\'s bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.\nI know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againÑeven if it means I have to walk to work.\nYou have to stand up for what you believe in.\nRosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.\nI don\'t like being in the spotlight, and I don\'t want to put my family in danger.\nRosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.\nGood. In the meantime, we\'re going to boycott the buses.\nThe next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.\nSCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later\nRosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.\nThe steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.\nYour place is in the back of the bus, lady!\nOh, she\'s so sweet. They\'ve messed with the wrong one now!\nAfter Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.\nI politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.\nRosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.\nI find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.\nThe crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.\nYou haven\'t heard the last from us.\nDespite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation\'s highest courtÑthe Supreme Court.\nMontgomery\'s black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama\'s segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.\nAt the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20.

{'text': 'In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.\nMuseum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.\n"This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned," said a museum official. "It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate."\nWhy, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old\n, or man-made object, is one of the world\'s first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.\nAlong with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein\'s government in April.\nAt that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or\n, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.\nOne museum official referred to the looting as the "crime of the century." He said that it wasn\'t just a loss for Iraq, but that it was "a loss for all mankind."\n. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.\nMany people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam\'s government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.\nOfficials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum\'s entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.\nSome of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a "don\'t ask; don\'t tell" policy.\nThe policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, "It\'s going to be a long time before we know for sure what\'s missing."\nModern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,\nmeans "the land between rivers." There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\nThe area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That\'s because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.\nHere are some of the Iraqi National Museum\'s valuable artifacts and their status at the time\nThis 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.\nThis life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.\nHow did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?\nOriginally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world\'s earliest writing.

Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.\nUsing a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered.

Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love.\nLove is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love.\nThe idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle.\nAt this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.\nMore from Romeo and Juliet first key extract:\nRead the full text online and make your own notes.\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

{'text': "A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.\nThe properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex® have more useful properties than other polymers.\nPolymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).\n. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:\nethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene\na typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle\na typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging\nSome polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.\nOne of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.\nWaste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.\nPolymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.\nPolymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are\nMany polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.\nMost polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.\nNylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:\nUnfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.\nGore-Tex® has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex® is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.\nTeflon® is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex®.\nGore-Tex® contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.\nGore-TexÂ® fabric is a sandwich of materials\nStructure and properties of polymers - higher\nStrong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:\nthe strength of the forces between these molecules\nA polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the material’s melting point.\nMany polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.\nCross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.\nVulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.\nfrom 2007 about a British firm that is developing plastic electronic materials which may eventually replace silicon chips.\n", 'label': '5'}

{'text': "Between now and the exam you need a clear idea of how to practise and improve.\nMake sure that you have a vocabulary book or record that covers each area of experience included in the syllabus.\nBuild up your personal vocabulary by learning a small number of new words every day.\nGet plenty of regular practice. Use past papers. Use this website - both the Revision Bites and the Test Bites. Try to go over your work with someone who can show you how to do better next time.\nMake sure you are familiar with different types of task that you might get on an exam paper, eg multiple choice, filling in a grid, matching, gap filling, answering in French, answering in English.\nGo over some questions with a friend. It will give you a chance to look at someone else's exam technique. You might learn from each other.\nMake sure you are confident with recognising the full range of words that introduce questions, eg\n' OÃ¹?' 'Qui?' 'Comment?' 'Pourquoi?' 'Quand?' 'Que?' 'Quel(le)?' 'Qu'est-ce que?'\nTry to find opportunities to read something that interests you in French without the pressure of questions and time limits. For example French magazines, comics, newspapers and internet sites.\nYou must come to the exam with a clear idea of the strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions.\nDon't panic! You are not expected to understand every word of the text.\nTake a positive approach to your reading. Concentrate on what you can understand, not on difficult words and phrases.\nHave a good look at the title of the text as well as any illustrations. They may give you some important clues.\nRead the whole text before attempting to answer any questions. It is usually better to read the text twice at a brisk pace, than to struggle along once, slowly.\nBe clear as to exactly what each question wants. For example: should you give precise details or an overall impression? When you are clear, go back to the text for the words that you need, and ignore the rest.\nBe aware of different ways of finding out the meaning of words. For example:\ncan you guess the meaning of a difficult word in a sentence if you understand what all the other words mean?\ncan you find similarities between French and English words (eg\ncan you find links with other French words (eg\nare you aware of language patterns (eg\nin front of a word often means again:\nUse your knowledge of grammar. For example: if you can identify a plural, a verb tense, an adjective, an adverb or a preposition, you will be in a better position to make an intelligent guess at a meaning.\nNow decide which strategies will work best for you and practise using them as much as you can between now and the day of the exam. The more you practise them, the more you are likely to remember to use them during the exam itself.\nUse your knowledge of France and French-speaking countries. For example, knowing about the French educational system could be very useful if you are working on a text about school.\nIf you have to write answers in French, be as clear as possible; but remember - you will not be penalised for small mistakes.\nDon't spend too long on a difficult item.
