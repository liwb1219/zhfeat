In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up\n.

The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.\nCyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others\' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids\' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.\nFor many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. "Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades," said Aftab.\nWhy is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nOnline experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being\n, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.\nSome kids also don\'t realize that they\'re cyberbullies because they don\'t see the consequences of their actions. "In face-to-face communication, we see when we\'ve gone too far," she says. "We lose all those visual cues online."\nTo address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.\nTeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: "Don\'t be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most."\n, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. "The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other," says Aftab. "If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you\'re part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution."\nOnline safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:\nDon\'t give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.\nDon\'t post any information online that you don\'t want others to read.\nDon\'t answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.\nDon\'t react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.\nRun your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don\'t want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.\nHow is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

People had forgotten that the area had played an important role in U.S. history.\nJust as the hospital became a school, other Civil War sites may be covered over. In the next ten years, many Civil War sites might disappear. People want to build houses, malls, and even golf courses on the sites.\n"Anything that isn\'t saved in the next decade will be forever gone," said historian Robert K.

The trust wants to raise enough money to buy the sites so that people can never build on them.\nThe Civil War is one of the most important wars in U.S. history. It lasted from 1861 to 1865. During the Civil War, 11 states broke away from the United States. The U.S. government then declared war on the rebel states to bring them back into the United States.\nThe breakaway states formed a new country called the Confederate States of America. The other states were called the Union. About 625,000 people died fighting the war.\nThe Union won the war and the rebel states eventually rejoined the United States. The end of the war also brought about the end of slavery in the United States.\nThe battles fought during the Civil War helped define what the United States is today. People want to protect the battlefields so that Americans will never forget their past. "This land just doesn\'t belong to a developer or a landowner, it belongs to America," said James Lighthizer, who wants to preserve the battlefields.\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.\nStepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that\'s just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.\nJamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. "The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607," historian Tom Davidson told\nDavidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.\nVisitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore\nor models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.\nThe story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called\nbuilt a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.\nor businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area\'s Powhatan people (see "\nAt first, settlers stayed close together for protection. "There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort," explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.\nCaptain John Smith was one of Jamestown\'s original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: "He who does not work, will not eat."\nspent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.\nBy 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a\nmeaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco\nor large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.\nOver time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (1775Ñ1783).\nMuch is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown\'s original location.\n"Visitors can see things being excavated that haven\'t seen the light of day in 400 years," Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told\nScientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.\nThe skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown\'s original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. "It\'s the biggest event we\'ve had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened," says Litterst.\nWhen the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. "There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown," Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told\nShe hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan\'s story.\nWhen Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.\nOver time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. "We have changed a lot," says Wood, "but we are still here."\nOrganizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration.

Find out how close her ride was to the real thing.\nkid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars.\nSonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World\'s Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.\nAfter her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride\'s creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future.\nOn her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. "We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it\'s like to be an astronaut," said Bryan.\nSonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum.\nBefore boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer.\nSonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role.\nAfter Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.\nThe mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! "I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face," she said.\nSo how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.\nScott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. "It\'s a thrill a minute," he said.\nAlthough no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride\'s liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.\nHowever, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of\n. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.\nThe blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don\'t experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.\nFor many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, "Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are."\nSonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here\'s what Sonia Mia learned.\nImagineers are people who work for Disney.\nIn general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.\nWhat was your role in creating the ride?\nI\'m the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.\nWhere did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?\nPeople have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.\nBefore the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn\'t feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?\nThat could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn\'t bother them at all.\nHow many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?\nAt last count, I\'ve ridden it more than 400 times!\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

India was one of 12 countries devastated by last yearâ€™s tsunamiÑone of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.\nNow, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.\nSome of those donations came from American students who\nor came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.\nNine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjmâ€™s village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. "We knew people who died, but my family was lucky," Selso told Weekly Reader. "We only lost our home."\nSelsoâ€™s mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsoâ€™s family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. "This is the happiest day for my family," says Selsoâ€™s dad, Michel. "My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework."\nWith the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.\n"When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope," said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.\nAs rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. "I was afraid to go back to the ocean," Sarjm says, "but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore."\nWhy is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?\nAfter the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased.

Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion\nProspero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero\'s magic island.\nProspero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a "spy", a "traitor", and an "impostor". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to "manacle" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have "control" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.\nProspero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.\nThe extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand\'s love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero\'s magic.\nMore from The Tempest first key extract:\nUp for a challenge?

The ship's crew are hard at work trying to stop the ship from sinking.\nAntonio, brother of Prospero (a magician, who appears later)\nThey think they are going to drown.\nThe action moves to an island near where the ship is in trouble. Prospero, a magician, and his daughter Miranda, are living on the island with two others.\nOne is Ariel (a sprite, or elf-like character) - who'd once been kept in a tree by an evil witch, Sycorax. Prospero had released him from the tree with his magic.\nThe other is Caliban (big and nasty, the son of Sycorax) - who Prospero had been kind to. Both Ariel and Caliban are Prospero's servants.\nProspero, we now learn, had caused the storm on purpose. It was because of something that had happened long ago, as he tells Miranda ...\nTwelve years earlier, he says, Prospero was the much loved Duke of Milan, a great city in Italy. Miranda was a young princess.\nProspero was always reading. This meant that his brother Antonio (who is on the ship in the storm) had so much power that he wanted more, and plotted against Prospero, with the help of the King, Alonso.\nOne night, Prospero tells Miranda, he and Miranda were seized, and sent out to sea alone in an open boat. They were lucky to survive, although Prospero's magic books were on the boat. Finally they came ashore on the island where they now live.\nWhen his story is over, Prospero makes Miranda sleep before calling for Ariel, to find out how the plans he has made for the ship in the storm are going.\nUp for a challenge?

Click to see the examiner\'s comments.\nWhat is the importance of Dr Lanyon in the novel, and how does Stevenson present him?\nDr Lanyon is an important character in Stevenson\'s novel because, like Dr Jekyll, he is a scientist and doctor, so he makes an interesting point of comparison and contrast. He is also the only character to actually witness the transformation of Hyde/Jekyll. His account of this is very interesting to the reader. Stevenson saves Lanyon\'s account until the penultimate chapter, where it dramatically solves most of the mystery about the character of Mr Hyde. (\nOpening paragraph briefly but clearly focuses upon a) the importance of Lanyon and b) the author’s presentation.\nDr Lanyon first appears in Chapter 2 when Utterson goes to consult him about the strange will of their friend Dr Jekyll. He is described as a "hearty, healthy" gentleman with a warm manner of welcoming his friend that is based on "genuine feeling". (\nQuotation shows evidence of the first bullet point in the question – what Lanyon is like.\n) This emphasis on his good qualities and his genuine friendship is important. (\n) It makes us trust him and believe his judgement may be right when he says that, because Jekyll "began to go wrong", he has seen little of him during the last ten years. In fact, he becomes uncharacteristically agitated and talks angrily of Jekyll\'s ideas as "scientific balderdash". This raises our level of interest in what Dr Jekyll might be involved in. (\nParagraph focuses on two different characters’ reactions to Lanyon - clear focus on the second bullet point.\n) is clearly very friendly with Lanyon, and likes him. Because Utterson appears in the novel much more frequently than the doctor, and is also a steady, reliable, caring man, we tend to trust Lanyon even more. Stevenson makes him appear a model of reliable good sense and decent friendship. Dr Jekyll also tells Utterson that Lanyon is "a good fellow... an excellent fellow". But he adds, "a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant blatant pedant", and scorns Lanyon\'s disagreement with "what he called my scientific heresies". (\n) This again raises our interest in what Jekyll is up to, because his attitudes toward Lanyon are wildly contradictory. (\nUp to this point in the novel, Stevenson has made me like and trust Dr Lanyon. He is possibly a bit stuffy (but only possibly - can Jekyll\'s judgement be trusted?), but his heart is in the right place. In Chapter 6 (Remarkable Incident of Dr Lanyon), however, Stevenson creates a shocking change in Lanyon. When Utterson visits him, he finds a man "with his death warrant written legibly on his face". As a reader, I (\nUse of "me" and "I" shows evidence of personal response, which the third bullet point asks for.\n) am concerned to find out why. But even though there are hints of a dreadful confrontation between him and Jekyll, a horrific mystery hangs over the cause. The previously cheerful scientist and doctor lives in dread, feels he will soon die, and refuses to talk to Utterson about their former friend, Jekyll. His words "if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God\'s name, go" show the author\'s skill (\nComments directly on how Stevenson makes you respond to Lanyon, which the third bullet point asks for.\n) in making the reader fascinated by the mystery.\nLanyon is important to the novel (\nFocuses clearly on the fourth bullet point – the examiner can easily follow the structure of your essay.\n) because of the dramatic mystery surrounding what he has seen. It excites the reader and draws us in. He is also important because, as a scientist and doctor, his disagreement with Jekyll\'s "wrong in the head" (\n) ideas shows us that Jekyll is thinking and working outside of normal science. Jekyll is "breaking the rules", an important theme in the novel which would be far less apparent without the character of Lanyon. (\nRefers to a theme of the novel.\n) In the penultimate chapter, Lanyon\'s account of what he has witnessed raises the ending of the novel to a fever pitch of horror. Finally, in Lanyon\'s terrified language, we learn that Hyde is Jekyll and that Lanyon witnessed the transformation - this is why he is important in Stevenson\'s novel.

{'text': "In the 1970's dance music moved into new venues called Discotheques, with faster, more 'bassy', electric music. By the 1980's the music had become faster, harder and more electronic. In the 1990's clubbing took over, DJs mixed their own music, and dance rhythms dominated popular music.\nDuring the 1970's, Disco music began to develop in the USA and around Europe. Music of this kind was quite fast, usually played at 120 BPM (beats per minute).\nDisco music became even more popular after the film Saturday Night Fever. Here is a BeeGees track that featured in the film:\nTwo features of disco music were a very strong bass part and a strong accent on the 2nd and 4th beats of the bar. Disco music often made use of riffs (repeated patterns of notes) on the bass guitar, guitar or keyboards.\nMany bands during the 1970's used a horn section as part of the band. This was the term used for a section of brass instruments, such as trombones, trumpets and saxophones. Some of these horn sections played very complex music and filling patterns.\nClick for an example of this - from the band\nGuitars in disco music were played with a clean rather than distorted sound. Other instruments used were the electric piano, electric guitar, bass guitar and drum kit. Occasionally, a string section was also included.\nSalsa is a style of dance music developed in Cuba. Today, you can hear salsa being played on dancefloors throughout the world.\nA noticeable feature of many salsa pieces is the use of syncopated rhythm.\nBands such as Gloria Estefan and the Buena Vista Social Club toured widely across the world, making salsa popular throughout the world. Click to hear a sample of a Gloria Estefan song.\nSalsa music usually contains many drums and other percussion instruments. The percussion all play different rhythms so that the overall percussion part sounds very complex. Often this is an example of ‘Polyrhythm’: the simultaneous sounding of two or more individual rhythms (eg 3 against 4), found in jazz, African, Cuban and minimalist music. Unlike disco music, salsa preferred the ordinary (acoustic) piano rather than the electric piano. Also included in Salsa music was a horn section, consisting of trombones, trumpets and saxophones. Here is an example:\nCall and response is very common in salsa music - where a soloist sings something that is immediately answered by a chorus or a section of musicians.\nClub dance music of the late 20th and 21st centuries has many different forms, including drum and bass, hip-hop, garage, R and B, trip-hop, house, rave, techno, ambient and europop. You won't have to know all the differences between these styles, but you will need to be able to pick out the main musical elements and comment on the use of technology in GCSE questions.\nClub dance music always makes use of technology. In particular :\n: where a pattern, usually in the bass or drum part, is repeated constantly.\n: where a voice or a sound clip has been processed by a computer to distort it.\n, an echo effect on the voice, and\n, where the voice is given a synthesised effect.\n: a DJ technique where the hand is put on the vinyl disc and moved backwards and forwards on the turntable.\n: This is a process on the computer where fast notes are automatically put into time by shifting the note to the nearest (usually) semiquaver. The effect of this is that the music is always completely in time with the beat.\n: Where each part of the music (bass, drums, main vocal etc.) is recorded on its own track. It means, for example, that a singer can perform the main vocal and later perform the backing vocal as well (overdubbing).\nListen to this piece of dance music from the 20th century and comment on:\n: The tempo is quite fast. There was lots of technology used in this, including synthesisers, drum machines and synthesised voices. There is a strong beat throughout this music which is important in dance music of this kind.\n. Not a very full answer, but he has got some credit for mentioning the strong beat and the instruments.\n: The tempo is around 100 BPM. The music uses lots of technology, like a repeated synthesised voice part singing 'I can feel the beat'. The synthesiser was probably played through a computer to get some of the effects and it has probably been put in time by the computer. The music builds up to a climax by having just one instrument then another then another and so on. Finally the drums come in at the end of the climax.\nSarah has picked out the main points of the music but could not use the special terms like loop, quantise, sample. Her guess at the tempo was slightly out. It was around 120 BPM which is exactly 2 beats a second.\n: The tempo is around 120 BPM. The music has loops in the rhythm part towards the end of the excerpt and the synthesiser part which has 4 repeated chords. A sampled voice singing 'I can feel the beat' is used with the last 3 words being repeated in the sample. The sample also has a fade. All the parts have been quantised. All the synthesised parts were probably composed on a sequencer. The 4 chord structure is built up during the piece, first by the synthesiser, then the voice comes in, then the bass part and finally the full rhythm part. Just before the rhythm comes in, there is a crescendo on the snare drum and a roll. Also, there is a glissando heard near the beginning on the synthesiser.\nA very full answer which is full of correct terminology. Geeta has picked out all the main points and also some of the not so obvious points, like the glissando on the synthesiser and the snare drum crescendo. All 4 points of the question fully answered.\n", 'label': '5'}

Read the paragraphs below - they've been made up by using ideas from the table on the previous page.\nIn our work on 'Food, Glorious Food' we looked at how we in the developed world have lots of food to eat and yet we have a problem in our society with young girls and some boys starving themselves in order to become thin. Nowadays it is fashionable to be thin and most of the stars of film and television are super-slim. Young girls see models and pop stars who are generally very thin and want to be like them. Although in our society there are now more obese people than ever before, because of our obsession with weight there are also more people who regularly diet to try and control their weight. An eating disorder sufferer can die if nursing staff are unable to get her to eat.\nIn another part of the world people are dying because of a lack of food. Sometimes this is because of drought, sometimes war and sometimes because their governments don't make sure that their people are well fed. We in the developed countries send aid to drought-stricken countries to help - although there are times when the aid doesn't get to the people it is meant for. Sometimes in these countries the people in power eat well and have all the advantages that we in developed countries have, while their people are living below the poverty line. In these countries to be thin isn't fashionable - they don't have the luxury of fashion as they are too preoccupied with staying alive.\nThe images of the two different people are so similar and yet their reasons for looking like this are worlds apart. How ironic that with all our advantages we abuse and waste our food - having food mountains that we can't sell and in poorer countries they haven't enough food to eat at all. How sad that we choose to waste or not eat our food, sometimes even to the point of death and there are those who die because they haven't got the basic foods they need.\nThe ultimate guide to getting started in drama.\nGeneral Theatre Links - Theatre Studies: Articles and Resources\nGreek Theatre - Wikipedia: Theatre of Ancient Greece\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

{'text': 'John Agard came to England from Guyana in 1977. Like many people from the Caribbean, he is mixed race - his mother is Portuguese, but born in Guyana and his father is black. One of the things he enjoys about living in England is the wide range of people he meets: \'The diversity of cultures here is very exciting\'.\nHowever, one of the things he doesn\'t like is the view of racial origins, which is implied in the word \'half-caste\', still used by many people to describe people of mixed race. The term now is considered rude and insulting. Find out more about the word \'caste\' at the end of this section.\nUnfortunately, we can\'t reproduce the poem \'Half-Caste\' here, so it may be helpful for you to have your copy of the AQA Anthology to hand.\nThe speaker in the poem ridicules the use of the term \'half-caste\' by following the idea through to its logical conclusion:\nPablo Picasso (1881 - 1973), famous Spanish painter and sculptor.\nbe seen as second-rate because he mixed a variety of colours in his paintings?\nShould the English weather be scorned because it is full of\nPeter Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840 - 1893), a famous Russian composer.\nbe seen as inferior because he used both the black notes and the white notes on the piano?\nIs someone who is called a \'half caste\' only half a person?\nThe poet asks the listener to begin to think in a more open-minded way.\nThe poem is written in five stanzas of varying lengths. Look carefully at the gaps between the stanzas (lines 38/39, 47/48 and 50/51). Why do you think the poet left these gaps, when the sentence seems to run on into the next stanza?\nThe lines throughout the poem are quite short, perhaps to hammer home the message.\nWhen you read the poem, you will notice that certain phrases (eg \'Explain yuself, half\') are\n, which builds up a pattern in the language. Do you think that this repetition is a successful way of strengthening the impact of his\nA text\'s central thought or sequence of ideas. (Not to be confused with an argy-bargy!)\nto make us see how stupid it is to judge things that are in contrasting colours as only \'half\' worthy. He uses examples of great and famous artists (Picasso and Tchaikovsky). What is the effect of this?\nHe also uses the weather as an example of something that is full of contrasting colour. Think about what the poet is doing when he uses the phrase \'overcast\' (line 20). It sounds like the same word as \'caste\' with an \'e\', but is actually an entirely different word. Do you think this adds to the\nof the poem? Agard said: \'I think humour can be very powerful. Humour breaks down boundaries, it topples our self-importance, it connects people, and because it engages and entertains, it ultimately enlightens.\'\nHe doesn\'t use the standard form of\n. This is partly because it\'s a poem that is written to be performed aloud. Agard said: \'Sometimes I think no punctuation can be effective because if the words are floating in space it gives the reader a chance to punctuate with their own breath...\'\nwhere standard English would use capital letters. Even proper names - like \'picasso\', or \'tchaikovsky\' - are written in this way. What effect does this create?\n-\'yu\' instead of \'you\', for example, or \'dem\' for \'them\'. Why do you think Agard chose to write \'Half-Caste\' in \'non-standard\' form?\nTry reading the poem aloud. What sort of tone should it be read in?\nAngrily, as a warning to everyone who uses the term \'half-caste\'?\nApologetically? The poem seems to start with an apology: \'Excuse me...\' Think about why that might be.\nPleadingly, as he tries to make people understand?\nSelect a short quotation (or quotations) to justify your choice.\nFinally, what idea is the poet seeking to get across in this poem?\ndid he write it? John Agard himself said of this poem:\n"This imposition of half, half, half on a person\'s total human complexity implies that some sort of \'purity\' has been subverted. A child of mixed race is a tangible, loving expression of human beings from different cultural backgrounds getting together - that should be seen not as something threatening, but as something enriching..."\nRead this question carefully. It is similar to the type of question you will be asked in the exam\nChoose two poems where the style and language of the poem seem particularly suited to what the poet has to say, and explain in each case why you think this.\nIf you are ready to practise writing a full answer, you should spend 40 minutes on this, and write about two poems. In the exam itself, you will only have\nRefer to anything you know about the\nof the poem which helps you to understand the poems.\nthe poem is written, referring to particular words and phrases.\nWhat do you think the poet has to say about the past, and the way it relates to the present?\nIf you would prefer to concentrate on just John Agard\'s poem at this stage, write for 20 minutes.\nIn writing about John Agard\'s poem, you could include short paragraphs about:\nWhat the poet has to say in this poem.\nThe style in which the poem is written.\nIf you want to practise writing a full answer, you could actually choose any of the other poems as your second one, because this is a very broad question. However, the poems by Sujata Bhatt or Tom Leonard would be good choices.\nWhen writing about two poems, you should try and end by making a comparison between the two. In what ways are the poems similar - in style of language, or in ideas? In what ways are they different?\nThe poet says excuse me standing on one leg I\'m half-caste. Half-cast means when you have two different races, like when a canvas is red and green.\nmix red and green is a half-caste canvas.\nBut he says if you come back tomorrow you will see a different (whole) person instead of only half the story.\nand I will tell you de other half of my story.\ncandidate seems to have grasped roughly what the poem is about\nhowever, the paragraph is poorly expressed, so the ideas are very unclear\nthe writing is poor with words being joined together\nthe quotes don\'t quite connect with what is said about them\nThe argument of the poem comes out in the way it is written. You could almost say that the poem is written in a mixed language - it\'s a kind of English, but it\'s also in Caribbean. The poet writes \'wid\' and instead of \'with\' to show that the speaker has a Caribbean accent. Some people might call this half-caste language, saying that it\'s not proper English, but Agard would say it\'s just a different variety of English. Also, he writes in a jokey style, like I explained above, it\'s like he\'s teasing people who think he\'s "only" half-caste, and taking the mickey is a good way of putting your ideas across, and making people think again, which is why Agard wrote the poem. So the way the poem is written suits what it\'s trying to say.\nbecause this is a conclusion, it relates to detailed points made earlier\n', 'label': '5'}

{'text': "This Revision Bite will help you understand how a market can be divided into\nGroups with the same or similar needs and wants often divided by age, gender, income, lifestyle, and culture.\nand why segments are important in marketing.\nJust as you can divide an orange up into segments you can divide the population as a whole into different groups of people or\nGroups with the same or similar needs and wants often divided by age, gender, income, lifestyle, and culture.\nthat have something in common. Segmenting the market makes it easier to identify groups of people with the same consumer needs and wants. Marketers therefore look for categories they can use to divide up the population.\nDifferent products are targeted at children and the over 60s\nThe population can be divided by age in years (eg 0-16, 17-25) or by the stage of life reached (eg schoolchild, teenager). For example, a pensioner will have similar needs to those of other pensioners but different needs from those of a teenager.\nProducts can be targeted at men or women\nProducts may be targeted at a specific gender group. For instance, cosmetics have been traditionally targeted at women while DIY has been targeted at men.\nProducts can be targeted at different cultural groups\nPeople's needs and wants as consumers will vary according to their religion, language, social customs, dietary habits and ethnic background. In the UK businesses provide for a wide range of different cultures. For example, there are magazines and newspapers in many different languages and Halal butchers in areas with large Muslim populations.\nThe market can be divided into socio-economic groups\nThe population can be segmented according to annual salary (eg £15,000, £30,000 etc.), or type of job and social class. Establishing a group's\nMoney left after essentials are paid for.\nis important so that products can be targeted to the relevant income group. This is called a\nGeneralised group by job, class and income.\n. The socio-economic groups A, B, C1, C2, D and E describe how much the head of the household earns.\nProducts can be aimed at a lifestyle group\nPeople are grouped according to the way they lead their lives and the attitudes they share. For example, young professionals may drive a sports car because of the image they want to project. Married parents might want the same things, but have to provide for their children, which is a large extra cost. They will need a family car to suit their lifestyle.\nMarketing departments use segmentation so they can target their products more accurately. It affects each of the 4Ps in their marketing mix:\nIf the product is effectively segmented a company will be able to promote the right product, at the right price and use the right distribution to reach the place where the consumers are.\nNow look at the way the 4Ps are used in market segmentation.\nCar manufacturers often produce a range of models to suit different markets\nFirms have a range of products that will be targeted at different groups or segments. For example, a car manufacturer will often have a range that includes a family model, an\nmodel and a sports model. Lifestyle segmentation will be used to develop their product line and to target their products.\nPrice and quality are obviously linked but not everyone can afford to buy the most expensive goods. There is a large range of televisions on the market, for example, each with slightly different features. Within this range of products, there will also be a range of prices to cater for varying disposable incomes.\nStudying how a product is advertised can reveal its\nthe end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell\n. A mobile phone company recently used advertising campaigns that varied for men and women. The male phone was pictured in black and white, and all its features and business applications described. The female phone was in bright colours, and was pictured as a matching accessory to go with a woman's lipstick and handbag. You may not agree with this stereotyping, but it is a good example of gender segmentation.\nA firm needs to know where its target market is. For example, a producer of Kosher food needs to identify areas where Jewish people live. The firm would have to consider how best to get its product to these areas. This is an example of cultural segmentation.\nPlanet Airlines has three types of seat on its planes: First Class, Business Class and Economy Class. The service you receive in each is different, as is the price you pay. Give one example, for each 'Class', of whom they hope to sell to, stating your reasons. (3 marks)\nWhen you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.\nExam questions are usually based on case studies. Look carefully at your case study to see if there is any information on market segmentation.

Business Class would probably be sold to business people and Economy Class to poorer people.\nMandy's answer was very basic. She has shown some understanding of the subject, but should have given far more detailed reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.\nPlanet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people, because they can afford to spend more money. Business Class would probably be sold to business people, because they need more space to work on the plane.

Many of these will be in high managerial jobs with a large disposable income, and can afford to spend more money on luxuries.

It is impossible to prevent weather from affecting a region but there are measures which can be taken in order to minimise the impact.\n. The different names all mean the same thing, but are used in different parts of the world. If these huge storms start in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa, they are called hurricanes.\nIn an average year over a dozen hurricanes form over the Atlantic Ocean and head westwards towards the Caribbean, the east coast of Central America and the southern USA (Florida in particular). Hurricanes may last as long as a month and although they travel very slowly - usually at about 24 km/h (15 mph) - wind speeds can reach over 120 mk/h (75 mph).\nMap showing route of hurricane Mitch, 1998\nHurricanes need a lot of heat to form and a sea surface temperature of at least 26 degrees, which is why they usually occur over tropical seas. They also need to be between 5 and 20 degrees north or south of the equator. It works like this:\nWarm air rises quickly, causing towering clouds, heavy rainfall and intense low pressure.\nThe low pressure sucks in air, causing very strong winds which spiral - anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere - around the centre of the low, at speeds of around 120 km/h (75 mph).\nSeen from above, hurricanes are huge circular bodies of thick cloud around 450 km (300miles) wide. The cloud brings heavy rain, thunder and lightning.\n, about 45 km across (30miles) across. Often there will be no cloud in the eye. Seen from below it will seem calmer, with a circle of blue sky above. The eye is formed because this is the only part of the hurricane where air is sinking.\nIn the northern hemisphere, the prevailing easterly tropical winds tend to steer hurricanes toward land - although their course is unpredictable.
