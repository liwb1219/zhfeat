Now those scientists have found a way to study the sounds and what the sounds mean.\nIn a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.\nScientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.\nScientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.\nScientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.\nThe African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.\nAn elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.\nAn angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.\nMove over Backstreet Boys, something bigger is now on music store shelves. The Thai Elephant Orchestra released its first album last December. The orchestra is made up of six Asian elephants from the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. The center is located in Lampang, Thailand. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia.\nThe elephants play many instruments, including drums and a xylophone. The money raised from album sales will be used to care for baby elephants.

Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.\nWith UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.\nOne or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.\nChildren in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.\nTo help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.\nChildren in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.\nSome classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.\nBut UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.\nUNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.\nYou can learn more about UNICEF and what you can do to help kids in other countries at UNICEF's Web site\nWhiskers' Thinking Page: How Do You Get to School?\nWhiskers' Thinking Page: How Do You Get to School?\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n", 'label': '1'}

This is good, because I need Polly\'s help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? "Polling Place. Live Here. It\'s Nice." I told you it was lame.\nThat\'s why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it\'s up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.\nPolling Place: A Place That\'s Right on the Numbers.\nPolling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!\nHow are Polly and I going to find out everyone\'s opinion? It won\'t be easy.\nA few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don\'t have the time to go to every person\'s house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don\'t fit.)\nSo what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)\nis a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think.

(You know, the big thing that\'s on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.\nSo, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!\nBelieve it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!\nIn those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn\'t get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.\nWhy was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.\nBy the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.\nThe people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A\nis a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll\'s sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.\nA poll\'s questions must be thought out. The questions need to be\n. That means the questions don\'t lead people to answer one way or another.\nFinally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the\n, or people\'s answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.\nIt\'s as Easy as One, Two, Three\nSo how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here\'s how we did it.\nThe first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy!

{'text': '? ItÕs hard to imagine. An invention is a new thing or idea. It can change the way people live. Some inventions solve problems and make life easier. Other inventions make life more fun (or tastier!). Read about some great inventions.\nThe next time you stick on a Band-Aid, you can thank Earle Dickson. He invented the ready-made bandage in 1920. He wanted to help his wife who often cut her fingers while cooking.\nAt the time, people had to cut pieces of gauze and tape to make bandages. They were hard to use. DicksonÕs simple idea was a big success. Today, ready-made bandages come in many shapes, sizes, and colors.\nDid you know that chocolate chip cookies were a mistake? Ruth Graves Wakefield created them in the 1930s. She was mixing a batch of chocolate cookies and was out of baking chocolate. She decided to chop up a bar of semisweet chocolate instead. When the cookies were done, the pieces of chocolate had not melted! They had kept their chip form in each cookie.\nBefore the 1920s, people often got into traffic accidents.

The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk.\nBats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can\'t. The animals\' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to\n, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster. Scientist Sharon Swartz says bats\' control of their wings is similar to humans\' control of their hands. "Bats are the only flying animals whose wings are really just like human hands," she told\nSwartz and the other scientists will study about 20 species of bats over the next five years. They are using real bats, high-tech cameras, and wind tunnels in their research. The team hopes to find out why bats can turn sharply without falling. If airplanes could do that, they could\n, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats\' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight.\nSwartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. "We expect to be studying bats long into the future," she says.\nIt\'s going to be a hair-raising Halloween for Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Three vampire bats were born there recently.

Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.\nKids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?\nOne way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.\nSome Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.\n? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.\nEarthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.\nMany people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '2'}

Giant streaks of lightning flash across the sky.\nWhen people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.\nLightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!\nWhen lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. "Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area," said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.\nWhile it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.\nWatching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous.

They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat.\nGreg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling.\nChris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake.\nU.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor.

Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.\nWhen worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body\'s strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.\nHowever, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that\'s quite a burden!\nBelow, you\'ll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!\nChoose a backpack that is the right size for your body.\nUse both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.\nAdjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.\nPack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.\nWhat are other ways you can help improve your posture?\nThat means you should bend at the knees when you pick up your backpack.\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun\'s surface.\nSunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun\'s surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.\nWhen the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface.

About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth\'s atmosphere.\nWhen a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.\nThe sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.\nA car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.\nIt takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.\nWhen solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth\'s atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.\nThe northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.\nScientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.\nsenior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state.

"Horses make excellent guides," said trainer Janet Burleson. "It is very common in the wild state for a blind horse to bond to a sighted horse that it uses as it\' guide."\nGuide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs. However, not just any small horse can be a guide horse, says Burleson. It needs to have the right personality and intelligence level. Like a guide dog, Cuddles has been house trained. She will tap her hoof on the door when she needs to go outside. Unlike guide dog, however, she doesn\'t sleep in the house. Instead, she sleeps in a small barn.\nShaw says that everyone wants to pet Cuddles because the tiny horse is so cute. But people should not pet Cuddles or any other service animal. Petting can distract a guide animal from its job of keeping a blind person safe. Cuddles and Shaw have traveled many places together, including the Empire State Building in New York City.

Now astronauts are preparing for another mission to our space neighbor. This time, though, they plan to stay there.\nNASA recently announced plans to build a permanent base on the moon. Astronauts could be living and working there by 2020, according to the U.S space agency. The goal is to prepare astronauts for a trip to Mars in the future.\nUnder the plan, four-person crews will begin with weeklong missions to the moon.

While on the moon, astronauts plan to use natural resources for water and fuel.\nThe moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. About 238,900 miles away, the moon is Earth\'s closest space neighbor.\nOn July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon.

For their trek to the moon, astronauts will travel aboard the new\ncrew exploration vehicle, which is being developed. The vehicle, a modernized version of the\ncraft, will attach to a lunar lander.\nThe moon mission is part of President George W. Bush\'s longterm space plan. The proposed base is the first step in the bold plan to prepare astronauts for their ultimate destinationÑMars.\nBecause Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. Astronauts will not be able to bring enough supplies for the entire mission. They will have to use the elements on Mars to survive.\n"By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time," says Braukus of NASA.\nWhile some supporters are jumping over the moon about launching a new era of space exploration, not everyone is pleased with the plan. Critics warn that it will be difficult to fund the moon program. So far, NASA has not put a price tag on the mission but welcomes participation by other countries to help carry out its plan.\nIn October 1957, the Soviet Union launched\nthe first artificial satellite in space. The U.S. space program was established as a response. The "space race" between the two countries had begun. In 1961, President John F.

Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.\nIt’s Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks it’s a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. "We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but it’s not ready," says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. "If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesn’t do it."\nShould grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species?

Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.\nDemarest said Cancu始 is different from other Mayan cities.

Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.\nHonor the 300th birthday of one of our countryâ€™s greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.\nEach morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, "What good shall I do today?" And that is how he lived his life.\nHis can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americaâ€™s most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.\nBen was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Benâ€™s education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.\nHis love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.\nIn honor of the 300th anniversary of Benâ€™s birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.\nACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723\nBenâ€™s older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,\nIn 1718, Benâ€™s father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.\nAt that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.\nBen likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingÑand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Benâ€™s sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,\nbecomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.\nJames finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Benâ€™s writing again. He also finds fault with Benâ€™s work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.\nI know I am a better printer than he is.\nYou canâ€™t leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!\nYouâ€™ll never find a job in this city! Youâ€™ll come crawling back to me.\nBut Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.\nThe journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.\nACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s\nAfter arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,\nA few years later, he also publishes\nThe book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Benâ€™s sayings, such as "Well done is better than well said." The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.\nAlthough Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.\nBen starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphiaâ€™s streets. He redesigns the cityâ€™s streetlights so that roads are safe at night.\nBen also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.\nExtra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!\nWe need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnâ€™t keep happening.\nBen persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.\nWe nominate Ben as our fire chief.\nBen is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.\n(dragging a leather bucket full of water)\n(helping a little girl from a burning house)\nThe Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.\nBenâ€™s ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.\nACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776\nAlong with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.\nAt the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.\nBen works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britainâ€™s ruler, King George III.\nDespite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).\nBen is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britainâ€™s rule.\nWe have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.\nI wonâ€™t. Many people disagree with my opinions.\nI canâ€™t. I am not a writer.\nI am unsure about independence from Britain.\nYou must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.\nWhen Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.\nIâ€™ve made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\nOn July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.\nThis for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.\nOn August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.\nSeven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.\nBen Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia.

In comparison, schools for white students were newer and had smaller class sizes and better supplies.\nWhen Linda was denied entrance to the all-white school, her father and 12 other parents sued the Topeka school system.

Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test.\nThe scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild.\nAfter spending four years in the country\'s mountainous region, scientists completed the largest\nof giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count.\nThe results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. "We found giant pandas living in areas we didn\'t know had any," scientist Colby Loucks told\nAlthough the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most\nanimals. That means there are very few left in the wild.\nHuman activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their\n, or home, is being destroyed as people cut down trees to get wood and to make farmland.\nGiant pandas must eat a lot of bamboo to get the nutrients they need. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, because it is not very nutritious.\n, or go into a long sleep, in the winter, because they can\'t store up enough fat on a bamboo diet.\nA newborn panda weighs between 3 and 5 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter.\nEach front paw on a panda has an extra wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help the panda grasp bamboo shoots.\nScientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. "Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild," said Loucks. "They hide in the thick\nBamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant\'s stems and leaves a day.\nIn fact, the giant pandas\' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation.\nTo collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas.\nHow will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more\nfor giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves.\n"Pandas live in the same place as other animals," said Loucks.

Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\nRoute 66 has been called the "Main Street of America." It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.\nIn the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.\nThe road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,\n, as well as a famous song, "Get Your Kicks on Route 66."\nIn the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.\nEven though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That\'s why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, "America on the Move." The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

"The environment was so awful, I couldn\'t imagine they wouldn\'t have problems," Otto told\nSo she organized a study to track the dogs\' health.\nToday, more than five years later, Otto has surprising results: Many of the dogs are fine. In fact, the dogs in her study are just as healthy as other search-andrescue dogs not involved in the 9/11 recovery efforts.\nDeja Vu is no exception.

That system protects the body against diseases and infections. For example, respiratory problems such as asthma are unusual in dogs. Otto and other researchers say that may be why the search-and-rescue dogs haven\'t developed any breathing disorders.\nThe scientists also think the dogs in the study may be healthier than the people who worked at the sites because most of the canines spent less time at the disaster sites than their two-legged counterparts. Many rescue workers who developed breathing problems spent months volunteering after the attacks. The dogs in Otto\'s study spent an average of 10 days helping.\nScientists may never pinpoint the exact reason that most of the dogs in Otto\'s study are in good health.

How well does the character reflect your experience growing up?\nI think it's a very accurate portrayal in terms of Harry's confusion and fear of growing up, and the challenges he knows it's inevitable he will face. That's what Harry Potter is about for me. It's not magic. It's not good versus evil. It's about a loss of innocence, going from a little kid to a young man.\nSpeaking of good versus evil, fans begin to learn more about Harry's least favorite teacher, Severus Snape, with the forming of the Order of the Phoenix. Whose side do you think Snape is on?\nThat is the ultimate question. [What] if I go out and say deep down, he's a really decent chap, [and he turns out to be bad]?

{'text': 'Scooters are one of the hottest fads in the country. But as the number of kids who zip around on the silver scooters skyrockets, so does the number of injuries. Doctors reported treating 9,400 scooter-related injuries in the United States between January and August 2000.\nAccording to the National Safe Kids Campaign, children younger than 15 were hurt in nine out of ten of those accidents. In one-third of those scooter accidents, the rider fell and broke or dislocated an arm or a hand.\nMost scooter accidents happen when a rider goes too fast and does not wear safety equipment.\nSafety gear helps protect riders, who usually ride at about 4 miles per hour. But some people cruise at speeds of 25 miles per hour or more. In England, police gave a man a ticket for racing a scooter at 39 miles per hour!\nThe number of scooter-related accidents has prompted some U.S. communities to pass laws requiring kids who ride scooters to wear helmets and other safety gear. Many states already have helmet laws for kids who ride bicycles, and some have helmet laws for kids who use skateboards and in-line skates.\nAnn Brown, an official with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, recommends that kids use safety gear when riding scooters. "We\'re trying to head off some of the kinds of injuries that happen with in-line skates," Brown said about scooter safety. "We want people to know about the safety gear early on."\nThis isn\'t the first time scooters have been popular. Scooters have been around since 1816. According to Annette Thompson of the Bicycle Museum of America, the first scooter was made from a board and two large wheels.\nEven if scooter riders are careful, accidents can happen. Here are a few safety tips that scooter riders can use:\nAlways wear a helmet, wrist guards, and elbow and knee pads;\nMake sure your scooter works properly and is not broken;\nRide only on smooth surfaces free of traffic;\nNever hitch a ride from a bicycle or a motor vehicle;\nIn the 1930s, kids nailed roller skates to milk crates to make homemade scooters. Scooters remained popular until the 1980s, when skateboards and in-line skates became popular.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.\nElementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.\nPeople in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today\'s world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. "Teachers can be a little more creative," she told\nStudents aren\'t just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. "The kids get so involved in these things because it\'s not all book work," says Oliver.\nCritics argue that extended school days could be too long for today\'s busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn\'t be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.\nOther people point out that longer school days\nwith, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs.

The main mission of the Apollo program was to put Americans on the moon.

Later, the vehicle will carry four astronauts to the moon for a weeklong mission.\n\'We will ... extend the human presence across the solar system and beyond.\'\nThe moon mission is part of President George W. Bush\'s long-term space plan. Last year, the president promised to return astronauts to the moonÑthe first step in an eventual mission to Mars.\nThe main goal of the mission is to build a research base on the moon where humans can live and work. The moon is very different from Earth. Unlike Earth, there is no air, wind, or weather. The moon\'s dusty surface is pitted with craters.\nWhile on the moon, astronauts hope to demonstrate that they can "live off the land." Learning how to live off the land is important for future human missions to Mars. Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time.\nThe United States has already begun using robots to explore Mars. Two robotic vehicles,\n, are on the Red Planet now. They are searching for signs of water, a requirement for life. Another vehicle, called an orbiter, is on its way. The orbiter is set to arrive in March and will circle Mars, studying the planet for signs of water.\nShould We Go Back to the Moon?\nAlthough some space experts and lawmakers praise the plan to return to the moon, others oppose it because of the high cost. The project is set to cost $104 billion.\nSome people think that money should be used for other causes, such as helping to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes Katrina and Rita. But NASA is quick to defend the space program. "[It] is a long-term investment in our future," says Griffin.\nOthers say that the public needs to keep being reminded of the ultimate goal. Scientist Louis Friedman says, "If you don\'t keep the Mars mission out front, people are going to ask, \'Why are we returning to the moon?\' It\'s got to be because we\'re extending ourselves into the solar system."\nIn 1961, President John F.

So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition.\nIn January, Farid traveled to the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City to talk about how the kids in his country are suffering from the war.\nAzerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.\nIn 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.\n"The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan," Elmira Suleymanova, Farid\'s grandmother, told\nfrom her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. "No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground."\nAccording to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.\nNo one knows if Farid\'s petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.\nMoving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.\nPresident Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.\nThe Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The "river of grass," as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.\nA large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.\nAn alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.\nThe Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nOne important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide\nBy removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That\'s when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.\nThe act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.\nThe maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.\nMany people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. "This is as major a restoration as one would hope for," said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.\nCritics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.\nWhatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to "roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years."\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.\nThe warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space.

"[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it," the 12-year-old told\n"After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable."\nCarlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.\nDouglass’s physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. "Sometimes they’re so excited, they fall. They’re screaming, ‘I’m doing it! I’m doing it!’" says Cendali, laughing. "It’s such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles."\nPE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports "the new PE." These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood\nby getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.\nSince 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBecause students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. "[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests," says West Middle School’s afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.\nSome people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. "Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed," says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.\nCarlos’s skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees.

Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.\nMauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea "is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm." These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.\n, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.\nCurrently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.\nThe use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli\'ahu.\nAccording to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.\n"We don\'t get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it\'s our land," said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.\nUniversity officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.\nAccording to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.\n, which is a type of government led by a king or queen.

The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.\nNot surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska\'s state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.\nDuring that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies.

"The clock is ticking," says scientist Jen Palmer.\nBetween the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the sealsâ€™ habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.\nHowever, scientists are now looking at the sealsâ€™ diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals.

He was searching for clues to explain how the once-mighty Inca Empire had disappeared.\nHis journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy.

One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff.\nAfter crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the "lost city" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo).\nUntil Bingham\'s discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means "old peak."\nThanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called "Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas," is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum.\n"It is the first exhibit of its kind," museum project manager Hillary Hansen told\n. "It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects."\nthat Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago.\nMachu Picchu is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas.\nThe Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina.\nTheir vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s.\nWhen Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time,\nhave learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.)\nThe Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there.\nMachu Picchu wasn\'t just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants.\nThe city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish\n(conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule.\nToday, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year.\nScientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. "In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu," said Hansen.\nMachu Picchu, which is located in Peru, was a city of palaces, temples, farms, and small houses.\nMany of the buildings at Machu Picchu are made of large stones. The stones are so tightly wedged together that a piece of paper cannot fit between them.\nMachu Picchu\'s farmland was carved into steps because it was hard for farmers to plow up and down the mountain. That allowed farmers to plant crops on the flat parts of the land and prevented rain from washing soil downhill.\nThe Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel.

She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.\nShe has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a\n, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free.\nBut Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.\nTo her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.\nThis bat lady, however, doesn’t keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.\n. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but they’re actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.\nBats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. "There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do," said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.\nHowever, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.\nBut Griswold’s message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. "The kids are making such a huge difference," she said.\nThere are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bat’s face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.\nVampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but it’s usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victim’s skin.\nEgyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit.\nThis bat’s ears are almost as long as its head and body. It uses its ears to detect insects. This bat, which is found in parts of North America, feeds mainly on moths.\n(EHK-oh-loh-kay-shun) to navigate in the dark and to find insects. The bats make sounds that can’t be heard by humans. A bat knows where an insect is because the bat’s sounds echo, or bounce off, an insect and return to the bat’s ears. A bat can actually hear the footsteps of a tiny mosquito!\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

A new study links the increase in the number of overweight kids to an increase in the amount of TV kids watch.\n"We found that kids who were [light] TV watchers were [thinner]. The kids who were the fattest were those who watch a lot of TV," said Dr. Carlos Crespo.

Watching that much TV, they said, is unhealthful.\nAccording to the doctors, kids are not entirely to blame for watching too much TV. Part of the problem comes from a lack of safe places for kids to play.\nCrespo and Anderson aren\'t against watching TV, as long as kids limit the time they spend in front of the tube.\n"There are a certain number of hours in the day you\'re supposed to sleep [and] do your homework," said Crespo.

{'text': 'Is silencing parents a winning idea for kids\' sports?\nLoud parents are a growing problem at youth sporting events. Nearly 60 percent of people think that parent behavior in youth sports is worse today than it was five years ago, according to the National Association of Youth Sports. "Parents are trying to yell and scream to make their kids play better, and that just doesn\'t work," sports expert and former coach Gregory Dale told\nDale and other sports experts are fans of an idea called "Silent Saturdays." Silent Saturdays are special game days during which parents aren\'t allowed to yell, scream, shout, or even speak. They can only clap to celebrate good plays and whisper to each other. Sports programs from California to New Jersey have instituted Silent Saturdays. Is quieting the sidelines a good call?\nSilence helps keep parents\' behavior under control.\nSome sports leagues think zipping parents\' lips is a great idea. The Dynamo Soccer Association in Bourbonnais, Illinois, started having Silent Saturdays last year. "We\'re not trying to punish parents," Dynamo Soccer board member Ben Smith told\n"It\'s just a stress-free day for the kids."\nAt first, some parents were skeptical, or unsure, of the idea. But Smith says the quiet games were a big success. Instead of shouting, parents held encouraging signs and applauded. Everyone could hear the kids talking to each other on the field during the games. "There was no negative criticism throughout the day," adds Smith. This year, the Dynamo board is considering two Silent Saturdays, and nearby soccer leagues are giving the program a try.\nParents should be allowed to cheer on their kids.\nSilence doesn\'t work for everyone. For example, two grandparents in Bourbonnais were disappointed because they had traveled to cheer at their grandkids\' game, but they had arrived on a Silent Saturday. Some experts think keeping family members quiet isn\'t the solution. "Parents hate it," Jim Thompson, head of Positive Coaching Alliance, told\n"If you want parents to be positive, this is not the best way to do it."\nThompson says the solution is to train parents to cheer in a way that promotes\nor fair play. Thompson prefers "Honor the Game Days" to Silent Saturdays. What\'s the difference? "Rather than telling parents to be quiet, at Honor the Game Days, [we tell parents] how to support their kids," he says.\nAre Silent Saturdays a winner for youth sports?

{'text': 'The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt\'s Valley of the Kings.\nQueen Nefertiti\'s name means "the beautiful one has come." It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.\nBut Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.\nMysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.\nled by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.\nModern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.\nWhat they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.\n"If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions," said Fletcher.\nScientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn\'t the only clue to the past.\nThere are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher\'s team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy\'s hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt\'s heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.\nIn addition, the mummy\'s left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy\'s forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy\'s bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.\nNot all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.\n"If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti," one archaeologist told\nAnother scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.\nBut Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.\nThe mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt\'s Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.\nScientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen\'s life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn\'t always the case.\n, ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings.\nThe pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).\n(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.\nMany historians think that when Nefertiti\'s husband died, she became pharaoh.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through\n, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.\nSeveral factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J.

According to Sen.

Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.\nAfter sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Le—n, had named the land\n, after a Spanish word meaning "flowery".\nLa Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto\'s men described the animals the explorers found. "There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there)," he wrote.\nMany different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.\nBecause the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.\nDe Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\nAfter reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.\nIn southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto\'s men, and some of his supplies were taken.\nDe Soto\'s expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.\nThe explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico.

The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.\nOne in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.\nThe two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt.

Watching violent shows could make some kids "think it\'s no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer," said Yokota.\nScientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don\'t show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they\'re causing.\nYou can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents.

A tomb is a burial place.\nAncient Egyptians buried King Tut in an area of hidden caves called the Valley of the Kings. It is located near the Nile River. Tut\'s mummy was discovered with an elaborate gold mask covering its head and shoulders.\nThe tomb was filled with royal treasures, including jewelry, statues, furniture, and even some of Tut\'s childhood toys.

A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.\nRepublicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.\nFor months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See\n"Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world," Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told\n"At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."

It’s up to the voters to decide.\nHere are some key issues on voters’ minds this election season.\nRecent polls show that Americans’ support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say it’s time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.\nGas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.\nAbout 45 million Americans don’t have health insurance.

Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.\nManatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.\nThe sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.\nA posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.\nHigh-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.\nGovernment officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.\nThe laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.\nDespite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.\nIs it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals?

Fantasy lovers are escaping into the imaginary worlds of\n(ZHAN-rah), or type, of book or movie that is set in a world completely different from our own. Fantasy is nothing new, although it has become all the rage again, thanks to author J. K. Rowling\'s brave boy wizard.\n"Hats off to Rowling," English professor Alida Allison of San Diego State University told\n. "She probably didn\'t expect this, but she started a [new] wave of fantasy reading."\nfor the second timeÑand he is almost halfway through J.R.R. Tolkien\'s\n. A trilogy is a series of three related books or movies that tell a story. What\'s the draw of fantasy? "Fantasy is full of action and excitement," says Jake.\nIt\'s not surprising that fantasy has turned millions of kids into book-worms. "Fantasy allows children to think about other worlds and contrast them to their own," says Allison. "It stretches their imaginations."\nWhat exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.\nIn a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In\n, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.\nFantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainÑand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?\nThe fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of\nmovies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\nwill hit theaters. It tells the story of four children who enter Narnia, a world filled with strange creatures.\nOn November 18, the fourth Harry Potter filmÑ\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\nÑhopes to work its magic on fantasy fans again. Jake can\'t wait to see it and compare it with the book. He is especially looking forward to the Quidditch World Cup scene. He says the filmmakers had "better not mess it up!"\ncaught up with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) on the set of\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n. Daniel, now 15, plays the boy wizard on screen.\n: How would you describe Harry these days?\nDaniel: He\'s grown up quite a bit. In this story, everything is being taken away, and it\'s out of his hands. Harry struggles to get a grip on the situation.\n: Are you shy, as Harry is with Cho Chang [his Goblet of Fire crush], in real life?\nDaniel: I\'m quite shy, but I\'d like to think that I\'m not. Sometimes I find myself not knowing what to say to [girls].\n: Which scenes did you most enjoy filming?\nDaniel: The underwater scenes were the most interesting and the most fun.

Just move your mouth."\n: If you could have any magical power of Harry\'s, what would it be?\nDaniel: [I would want to do] everything with the wand, like cast spells.\nIs it better to read the book first or see the movie?

An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.\nHow old were you when World War II began?\nWorld War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.\nWhere did you live, and did you have a car?\nAltogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.\nDid you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?\nYes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.\nDid you have enough food to eat every day?\nNo, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.\nHow did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?\nThey were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.\nHow was life affected by the occupation?\nThere was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.\nDo you have any comments about the occupation?\nMore than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people â€¦ who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.\nI learned that there was little freedom under the occupation.

The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That\'s because it is an active volcano.\nNearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world\'s tallest mountain.\nA thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling\npoured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano.\nThe explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano\'s fury.\nAlthough many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn\'t exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944.\nScientists warn, though, that it\'s only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. "It won\'t be tomorrow, it won\'t be next month, and maybe it won\'t be next year," a scientist who monitors the volcano told\n. "But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode]."\nToday, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the "red zone."\nOfficials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption.\nThe volcano\'s past, however, hasn\'t stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place.\nSome families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years.\nIn 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius.

The lights continually changed shape and color.\nare also called the northern lights and southern lights.\nUsually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.\nAuroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.\nThe kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.\nDon't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.\nThe sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.

Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.\nThe majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of\nsuch as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.\nThough people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingÑthe gradual rise in Earth\'s average temperature.\nHoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.\nFossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to\nsources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can\'t be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.\nPresident George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.\nAt CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. "I think the school is going to be a lot better," Drew Barsody, 10, told\n"I\'m looking forward to seeing the solar panels."\nThese wind turbines convert wind into electricity.\nHere are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.\nSolar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can\'t be collected if the sun isn\'t shining.\nEnergy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.\nis one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.\nEthanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles.

More than 20,000 Native Americans in traditional feather headdresses and clothing gathered in Washington, D.C., in late September.\nThey were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.\n"[The new museum] is a living tribute to the first Americans," museum director W. Richard West Jr. told the crowd. West is a member of the Southern Cheyenne tribe.\nNative Americans from Alaska to South America\n, or came together, for the museum\'s opening. A six-day festival followed the opening ceremony. The festival featured Native American dancing, music, foods, and storytelling.\nThe museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America.\nTen-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was "a great learning experience!"\nLibrary of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Edward S. Curtis Collection, [reproduction number, LC-USZ62-130198]\nNative American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.\nA wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum\'s items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.\nThere are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum\'s collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.\nThe 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won\'t just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.\nThe museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum\'s cafŽ.\nSymbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building\'s curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.\nIn honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum\'s entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.\nNative Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas "Indians."\nTo many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. "[It is] long overdue," said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.\nNow that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. "This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people," a Cherokee woman told\n. "Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here."\nWhy is the new museum an important part of Native American history?\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

Mount St. Helens in Washington state is showing signs of life and has left scientists scrambling to determine if it will blow its top.\n"Volcanoes are just like people--they\'re awake and active, and they go to sleep,"\n. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.\nIn September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large\n, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air.

Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.\nAlthough scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano\'s history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.\nMount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.\nHow can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? "We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases," said Driedger.\nAlthough scientists can\'t tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called\nare installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.\nVolcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.\nScientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of\n. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called\nwhen it pours out of the volcano.\nAs magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. "The gases are like telegrams that tell us what\'s going on inside the volcano," said Driedger.\nMore than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.\n"By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work," said Driedger. "The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives."\nBesides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict?

{'text': 'Tourists Put Pressure on World\'s Monuments and Parks\nSome of the World\'s most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to\n, or the destruction of property on purpose.\nEach year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists!\nThe problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs.\nThese are some of the special places that are suffering from too much attention:\n. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites.\n. Located in Peru, a country in South America, Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient city in the Andes Mountains. A people called the Incas built the city almost 600 years ago for Incan royalty. Garbage tossed aside by tourists, as well as air and water pollution, are now problems at Machu Picchu.\n. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of.\n. Located near the town of Dunhuang, in north-central China, these caves are covered with delicate paintings and carvings. However, the breath of the 300,000 visitors who pass through the 492 caves each year is damaging the artwork, which is between 700 and 1,700 years old.\nTo help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites.\nUNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, "You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow."\nIf you are visiting a monument or national park, here are a few rules the U.S. Park Service says you should always follow:\nIf you are camping, take your trash and leftover food out with you when you leave.\nWhen visiting a monument, don\'t touch sculptures, paintings, or other artwork.\nLeave any artifacts, plants, stones, or other things where they are.\nIf you see someone damaging a monument or throwing garbage on the ground in a park, tell a park ranger or another park official.\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.\nThose are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world.

Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.\nAccording to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.\nWorld temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.\nScientists aren\'t sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.\nSome scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth\'s atmosphere.\nCraig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants "will grow like gangbusters," he said.\nThe effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.\nIn the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.\nMichael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming.

Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.\nAmanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. "It was assumed in the past that children wouldn\'t have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage," Niskar said.\nNiskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a "problem for children," she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.\nHearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.\nFor example, hearing loss "can influence [a] child\'s ability to learn in the classroom," Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.\nNiskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.\nListen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear.

{'text': 'The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle\'s grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.\nThe disease attacks an infected bird\'s brain and spinal cord.\nAt first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.\nIn recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.\nAlthough the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.\nBy the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.\nWildlife experts are especially concerned because they don\'t know much about the disease, including what causes it. "We have some ideas, but we don\'t have any answers," John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.\nExperts also don\'t know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. "This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn\'t noticed," Fischer said.\nWhile wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.\nScientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America\'s bird--the bald eagle.\nThe bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn\'t true in 1782.\nBenjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.\n"I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country", Franklin wrote. "He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird".\nmeasures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.\nAll trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.\n', 'label': '3'}

Each year, kids are exposed to more than 10,000 television ads for candy, soft drinks, and other sugary snacks. Very few television ads promote healthful foods, such as fruits and vegetables.\nMany schools are changing their lunch programs to include more fruits and vegetables.\nTo help fight the problem, the U.S. government recently issued new guidelines for healthful eating. The guidelines recommend that kids exercise for at least 60 minutes a day and eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\nParents, schools, and health officials are also helping kids battle the bulge.

So far, only three of nine spacecraft that Americans and Russians have sent to Mars have completed the journey without breaking apart or failing.\nThe rovers were launched from a rocket and will travel through space in a protective shell. They will use parachutes and air bags to bounce to their landing sites. They will land on opposite sides of the planet.\nThe rovers are equipped with robotic arms, special tools, and cameras. As part of their mission, they will drill through rocks on Mars\' surface and take pictures of them.\nThen, they will then send the pictures back to Earth for scientists to study. Each rover can travel about the length of a football field each day.\n"We will be using the rovers to find rocks and soils that could hold clues about [the possibility of water in] Mars\' past," said another NASA scientist.\nMissions to Mars typically occur when the two planets are close to each other.

They think the candy-flavored cigarettes are safer than other cigarettes. They\'re dead wrong.\n(BEE-dees), come in colorful boxes and in different flavors, such as chocolate, grape, and strawberry. Michael Eriksen, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said bidis "are candy-flavored and cost less [than other cigarettes], so they appeal to some kids."\nBidis are not candy. They actually contain even more deadly poisons than other kinds of cigarettes. The American Lung Association says bidis contain five times more\nthan other cigarettes. Tar is a chemical that causes disease. Nicotine is a drug that makes people crave cigarettes.\nHealth experts also say people who smoke bidis have to puff longer and harder than they do with other cigarettes. That means smokers breathe in more poisons.\nIn every state, it is illegal for kids to buy cigarettes, including bidis. The U.S. government has also banned the importing of bidis because child laborers often make them.\nThe laws, however, are being broken. Recently, a group of kids in Oregon went undercover to help the police. The kids, ages 8 to 15, were able to buy bidis in some stores.\nHealth experts say the best way to stop kids from using cigarettes is to give kids the facts about how deadly cigarettes are. Another way to keep kids from smoking "is to get adults to quit, because they are the biggest role model for kids," said health expert Greg Conley.\nSmoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe.

For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.\nSwain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.\nWhy did he do it? "Every waterway needs a champion," Swain told\n. "I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up."\nIn 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.\nThe Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark\'s journey. Today, it is ravaged by\n, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river\'s salmon population.\nthat have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.\nThe pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.\n"The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty," Swain told\n. "It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth."\nDespite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.\n"With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around," Swain said. "Kids know that they want clean water."\nEarlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn\'t finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.\nHow will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? "I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day," he promised.\nEach year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.\nThis year, the Earth Day theme is "Water for Life."

Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become\n, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.\nToday, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are\ncreatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.\nTo search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.\n"Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won\'t cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees," said one wildlife expert. "We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive."\nWhat is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest\nHumans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals\' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.\nForest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.\nIn addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.\nTo help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.\n"Help is needed to save these amazing creatures," orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told\n. "If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well."\nThe average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.\nThe orangutan got its name--which means "person of the forest"--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.\nAre there any endangered animals in the area where you live?

Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.\nYou might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.\nYour listeners will switch off if they can\'t hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you\'re unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask "Can you hear me at the back?"\nIf you speak too quickly, you won\'t be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.\nIf you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.\nYou don\'t have to gurn at your audience! But if you don\'t look like you\'re interested in what you have to say, your audience won\'t be either.\nAgain, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won\'t be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you\'re trying to make.\nUse them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about.

Don\'t baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.\nIf it\'s appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don\'t have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.\nMost people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:\nWrite your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.\nPrepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!\nPractice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.\nOn the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.\nImprove your public speaking and maybe you\'ll be TV Presenter one day.

There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.\nThe extract describes a cold, empty landscape.\nThe text states that the trees have been "stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost".\nThe land is described as "desolate" and it contains "a laughter more terrible than any sadness".\nThis suggests that the place is completely isolated.\nThe fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.\nIf you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly.

That would be\nas you haven\'t thought about any other views.\nA good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like "because" or "however" or "although".

You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!\nbut realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else.

When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.\nMiranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!\nMore from The Tempest second key extract:\nUp for a challenge?

The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have.\nThis is good for separating dissolved substances that have different colours, such as inks and plant dyes. It works because some of the coloured substances dissolve in the liquid better than others, so they travel further up the paper.\nfrom a liquid.

That's because sand does not dissolve in water.\nfrom a liquid (a soluble substance does dissolve, to form a solution).\nFor example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution.\nfrom a solution. For example, water can be separated from salty water by simple distillation. This method works because the water evaporates from the solution, but is then cooled and condensed into a separate container. The salt does not evaporate and so it stays behind.\nfrom each other.

Even the night imagery involves brightness with stars and the moon.\nThe metaphors and similes used by the characters in the first extract (especially Romeo) are quite complicated. Benvolio and Romeo enjoy using puns to make jokes together. Language is used in clever ways.\nRomeo still uses language skillfully, but Juliet wants honesty rather than clever poetry. When Romeo starts to swear by the moon, she won't let him finish his clever metaphor. Juliet uses imagery to make her thoughts clear, eg Romeo is like a rose; Juliet's love is as deep as the sea.\nMuch of the first extract is in rhyme. In the scene between Romeo and Benvolio, this helps to bring out the humour in their banter.\nRomeo and Juliet both speak in blank verse: they are talking about love in a much more sensitive way than Romeo did when he was talking to Benvolio. Juliet's final line in the scene finishes Romeo's to make one line of blank verse. (Blank verse is unrhymed and has lines that have 10 syllables each). This shows how close they have become.\nIf you get a question about language in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with your answer:\nHow is love described in the two extracts?\nLove is described in many different ways in the two extracts. By the second extract, love is described in a more positive light.\nIn the first extract, Romeo uses oxymorons because he is confused about his feelings for Rosaline. Romeo compares love to poison and madness.\nIn the second extract, Romeo uses words to do with light and heaven when describing his feelings for Juliet. Juliet talks about love in terms of truth and promises.\nIn the first extract, love means many different things to Romeo. Love is confusing to Romeo and seems to have a dark side that he has no control over. Love is ruining his life. By the end of the first extract, you might think that Romeo has confused his feelings of lust for love. In the second extract, love is related to light and heaven for Romeo. Perhaps when he meets Juliet, he realizes what true love is. For Juliet, love is about truth and honesty. She is almost overwhelmed by her feelings for Romeo.

These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.\nThe Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.\nThe first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.\nBenvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.\nBenvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.\n- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio\'s opinion that Tybalt is \'fiery\', but Benvolio\'s description of Tybalt\'s behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.\nAfter that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.\nLady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn\'t involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.\nThe audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?\nMontague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won\'t open up to him.\nParents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.\nHe says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.\nThis is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.\nWhen Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.\n- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.\nRomeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn\'t love him back. He doesn\'t make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.\nThe list of opposites in Romeo\'s speech (\'loving hate\', \'heavy lightness\', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.\n"Here\'s much to do with hate, but more with love"\n- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it\'s about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it\'s about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.\nRomeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.\nRomeo\'s speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is \'all talk and no action\'.\nHe says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn\'t work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.\n- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it\'s about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.\nBenvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?\nWhilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio\'s responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.\nRomeo still won\'t give him a straight answer though.\nRomeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.\nHe tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn\'t want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn\'t interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!\n- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo\'s description of her to go by. It\'s hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn\'t fancy Romeo!\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste\nBenvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he\'ll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.\nBenvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.\n- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio\'s opinion that Tybalt is \'fiery\', but Benvolio\'s description of Tybalt\'s behaviour is full of hatred too.

Good endings should leave the reader feeling satisfied.\nTake a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing.\nIn conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.\nAs you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase "In conclusion". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that "compromise seems unlikely".

It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:\n, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.\n, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.\n, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.\nHowever, there are two endings to avoid:\n, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.\n, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.\nWhatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.\nWriting that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative.

{'text': "The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.\nAfter a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.\nNatalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.\n'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.\n'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'\nThe other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.\n'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'\nAt this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'\nNatalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.\n'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?\nHow does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?\nher first reactions to the girls she sees\nthe way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her\nher thoughts at the end of the passage.\nJust before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.\nWhen she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.\nWhack and zap mad professors and aliens!\nLove books?

{'text': '> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade\nArgue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade\nWhen you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don\'t need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn\'t really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.\nBut you wouldn\'t write about other makes of toothpaste. You don\'t persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren\'t sure. So the first thing to remember is:\n- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn\'t be so popular if they weren\'t really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it\'s much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...\n- it\'s always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people\'s are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren\'t chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don\'t be frightened to...\n- If you don\'t seem too sure, or if you can\'t make your ideas stand out, then you aren\'t really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders\' Toolkit.\n- don\'t worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.\n- using words such as "we" or "I" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don\'t we?\n- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?\n- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?\nFor instance, don\'t just write "the pressure of doing school work", because there is no real feeling there.

He describes the passage as being "draughty" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes "rang up and down" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.\nThe shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what\'s ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they "cower and quiver", come "sweeping up" and that they "fled". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what\'s in the corridor.

{'text': "A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic.\nIf you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules.\nHere are some simple rules for formal debates:\nFirst of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team.\nThen you need something to argue about. This is called a motion.\nThe proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about.\nThe opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say.\nThe last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument.\nYour team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out.\nUse these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can:\nUse facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible.\nUse opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion.\nListen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument.\nStructure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion.\nArguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.\nImprove your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day.

{'text': "> The Tempest second key extract - Characters\nThe Tempest second key extract - Characters\nIf you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.\nQuestion: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?\nIn the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.\nMiranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.\nShe relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.\nIn the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.\nMiranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.\nThroughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.\nMore from The Tempest second key extract:\nUp for a challenge?

They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.\nWhat would happen if the population of slugs decreased?\nSlugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.\nWhat would happen if the population of insects decreased?\nThere would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks.

In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:\nExplain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?\nThis difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:\nWrite a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.\nThis is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:\nHowever, you can also put these together, like this:\nNow, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?\nThis approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph.

This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:\nDuring the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.\nWrite a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.\n2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:\nAs a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree!

Juliet loses her temper and refuses. Her father comes in and can't believe how ungrateful she is being. He threatens to throw her out and disown her. He says he wants to hit her. She asks her mother to stand up for her, but she refuses.\nThe Nurse tells Juliet to forget Romeo and marry Paris\nWhen Juliet's mother and father have left, Juliet asks the Nurse what she should do. The Nurse says to forget Romeo and just marry Paris without owning up. In those days, that would have been a sin, and to marry two people at once would mean that she would be sent to hell. Juliet says that she will do what the Nurse suggests, but when she leaves the room, Juliet says to herself that the Nurse is two-faced. She decides to see if Friar Lawrence will help her. If not, she thinks she will have to commit suicide.\nParis goes to visit Friar Lawrence to arrange his wedding to Juliet. The Friar tries to stall for more time. When Juliet arrives, she gives Paris 'the cold shoulder' until he leaves. She begs the Friar to help her, threatening to kill herself. The Friar has a plan if Juliet has the guts to carry it through. He knows of a drug that will make her seem as though she is dead for forty-two hours. This will mean that she will be put in the family tomb along with Tybalt. Then the Friar will let Romeo know the truth, so that he can come and take her away when she wakes up and they can go off together to Mantua. Juliet isn't scared. She takes the drug home with her.\nEveryone is busy with wedding preparations at the Capulets' house. Capulet is in a good mood. Juliet tells her father that she has been to see the Friar to confess her sins and asks for her dad's forgiveness. Even the Nurse believes her.\nJuliet says good night to her mum then starts to panic about what she is about to do. She might die. She might go mad when she wakes up in a tomb full of dead people. There might be ghosts. She imagines that she sees Tybalt's ghost. She takes the poison and falls unconscious on her bed.\nThe Nurse finds Juliet and thinks she is dead. She is beside herself with grief. The family comes running and her mother and father can't believe it. Friar Lawrence arrives pretending that he has come to take Juliet to church to marry Paris.

{'text': "> Drama - Drama from your imagination\nTaking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.\nThis might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!\nAs with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.\nThe story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?\nHere are two ideas for a character:\nYou are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?\nYou are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?\nWhen you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.\nHere are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?\nYou're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?\nYou've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?\nYou've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?\nThe press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?\nYour article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?\nYou've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?\nWhen you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.\nYou may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.\nDon't be such a drama queen!

{'text': '> Analyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse\nAnalyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse\nThis is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.\nI\'m sure you\'ve all heard the saying "we are what we eat". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School\'s canteen.\nThe speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.\nA survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were "tasty, filling, cheap and quick". These choices, sometimes called "junk food", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.\nThe writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They\'ve imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it\'s relevant and makes sense.\nSome students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen\'s survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.\nThe final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase \'it is well known...\' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.\nSo far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument?

The microbes can get into a person who is scratched or bitten by such an animal.\nis a tropical disease spread by a tiny fly called a mosquito.\nFood can have harmful microbes in and on it. The microbes get into the body when the food is eaten, causing food poisoning. Thorough cooking kills most microbes, but they can survive under-cooking. Careless handling of food increases the risk from harmful microbes.\nMicrobes can be passed from one person to another when people touch each other, or when they touch something an infected person has handled. Athlete's food is spread like this.\nBacteria on the skin can be killed by antiseptics, and bacteria on surfaces can be killed by disinfectants. Washing your hands reduces the chance of spreading microbes.\nWater can have harmful microbes in it. The microbes get into the body when the water is swallowed.\nis a disease caused by a bacterium that spreads like this. Thorough boiling or adding chlorine to the water can reduce the chance of spreading microbes in this way.\nUse your knowledge to help Spherox find his way home.\nMore than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.\nBefore this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.\nThe First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.\nAriel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.\nHe wonders where the sounds are coming from.\nIllusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.\nHe follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.\nWhen Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.\nIllusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.\nProspero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along\nPower - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.\n, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.\nFerdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.\nMiranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.\nHe is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.\nProspero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.\nFerdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.\nThink carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?\nMiranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.\nLove - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?\nShe wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.\nWhen Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.\nProspero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.\nHe says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.\nPower/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.\nMiranda tries to speak up for him\nYou might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.\nbut Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.\nProspero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.\nWhen Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.\nMiranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.\nLove/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?\nProspero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel\nLove/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.\nProspero promises Ariel that he will be free\nFreedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.\nif he carries out all of his commands. Ariel agrees. Prospero orders Ferdinand to follow him and tells Miranda not to try and speak up for him.\nAriel's song calms the stormy waters.

{'text': '> The Tempest Summary - The shipwreck\nAriel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.\nProspero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king\'s ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.\nAriel now changes the subject, and says he\'s getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero\'s servant, after his release from Sycorax\'s spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he\'s been a good servant.\nIn order to see this content you need to have both\nProspero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.\nAs Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn\'t please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a "villain" that she does not "love to look on". It is clear, too, from the names he calls him, that Prospero has not forgiven Caliban for an attack he once made on his daughter.\nUp for a challenge?

Were you by when it began?\nHere were the servants of your adversary\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\nI drew to part them. In the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,\nWhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head and cut the winds,\nWho, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\nO where is Romeo? Saw you him today?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\nMadam, an hour before the worshipped sun\nPeered forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drove me to walk abroad –\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\nSo early walking did I see your son.\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\nAnd gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\nI neither know it, nor can learn of him.\nHave you importuned him by any means?\nBoth by myself and many other friends:\nIs to himself – I will not say how true –\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\nSee where he comes. So please you, step aside.\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\nOut of her favour where I am in love.\nAlas, that Love, so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\nAlas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould without eyes see pathways to his will!\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\nHere’s much to do with hate, but more with love.\nWhy then, O brawling love, O loving hate,\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it pressed\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:\nBeing purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\nBeing vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\nTut, I have lost myself. I am not here.\nThis is not Romeo: he’s some other where.\nTell me in sadness, who is that you love?\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will –\nA word ill urged to one that is so ill.\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\nI aimed so near when I supposed you loved.\nA right good mark-man! And she’s fair I love.\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\nWell, in that hit you miss. She’ll not be hit\nWith Cupid’s arrow. She hath Dian’s wit,\nAnd in strong proof of chastity well-armed,\nFrom Love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms,\nNor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\nO, she is rich in beauty – only poor\nThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\nBe ruled by me: forget to think of her.\nO, teach me how I should forget to think!\nTo call hers – exquisite – in question more.\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair:\nWhat doth her beauty serve, but as a note\nWhere I may read who passed that passing fair?\nFarewell.

Turning forces around a pivot are called\nIt is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.\n, we need to know two things:\nthe distance from the pivot that the force is applied.\nThis is the equation for working out a moment:\nImagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:\nNotice that the unit of moment is\n(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.\nHere is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.\nA see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.\nIf a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.\nUsing the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.\nSomething is pulling your mouse towards this link.\nJoin Questionaut's quest to find his friend's hat.\nMore than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

{'text': '> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise\nArgue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise\nOnce you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it\'s no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.\nFor instance, imagine you\'re writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won\'t be easy - they\'ll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.\nThe first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it\'s easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:\nIf you\'re not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.\nYou can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:\nIf you\'re not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it\'s the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don\'t be shy - it might be their first day too.\nIt is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it\'s also the style. It includes words like "might" and "can". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like "should, can, could, might, ought to and may" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.\nWant to get your own way?

Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss.

Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.\nRomeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom.

Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.\nHere is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.\nHow should an actor playing Benvolio behave?\nBenvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.\nWhen Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.\nThe way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing.

He seems to be exploring the idea of love. He may well long to be in love. Some of his ideas about love are confused and confusing.\nRomeo does not join in with the street brawl and is sad that the violence takes place. He says that he understands that the violence is more to do with love and loyalty towards family than it is to do with hatred. He has been unhappy for some time and his family is worried. When Romeo talks to Benvolio, he finds it difficult to make himself clear. He is more interested in using language cleverly. When he uses oxymorons like 'heavy lightness' it is as though he isn't really sure what love is. When he talks about Rosaline, he focuses on her beauty. He says he loves her, but he is annoyed by her virtuous personality.\nRomeo lives amongst people who will kill others and risk their own lives for the sake of their own family, so he knows about passion. The fact that he won't talk to his father about why he is unhappy isn't very loving. Romeo talks about love in an abstract way. He likes the idea of love, and he might have been influenced by what poets have said about love. It could be argued that if Romeo really loved Rosaline, then he would respect her wishes to remain a virgin. Towards the end of the extract, Romeo seems more interested in sex than true love.\nMore from Romeo and Juliet first key extract:\nRead the full text online and make your own notes.\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It\'s up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it\'s up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.\nTake a look at the following extract from Robert Westall\'s novel, \'Urn Burial\'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...\nThis was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.\nIn the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph\'s imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is "pressed" against a wall that is "cold as ice" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can "hardly breathe" because of the cold.\n. The simile; "a smooth wall cold as ice", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold "nibbled" at Ralph, it "ran up and down" his back and "invaded" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.\nWhat does it all mean?

These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.\nRomeo and his friends have left the Capulets\' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.\nThe second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet\'s garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.\n"He jests at scars that never felt a wound"\nHe watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun\nRomeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: \'sun\', \'stars\' \'brightness\'.\nand that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.\nRomeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.\nHe idolises her and compares her to an angel.\nWhen Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn\'t really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn\'t actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?\nJuliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn\'t a Montague, but says that it doesn\'t really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn\'t really mean that much.\nIf we used another word for a rose instead of the word \'rose\', eg \'poo\', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn\'t smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.\nWhen Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn\'t know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?\nWhat\'s in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other word would smell as sweet\nWhen Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.\n"My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself"\nWhen Romeo calls her \'dear saint\', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her \'dear saint\' at the party.\nJuliet is very worried for Romeo\'s safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.\nRomeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet\'s garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn\'t think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.\nHe declares that he\'d rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.\nJuliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn\'t give him the chance to answer.\nJuliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare\'s day, nice girls weren\'t supposed to show that they were interested in boys.\nJuliet\'s speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can\'t stop talking about it?\nRomeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won\'t let him finish.\nTime - Juliet won\'t let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet\'s mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.\nShe says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).\nShe worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.\nIt is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.\nShe tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can\'t seem to stop talking about it.\n"My bounty is as boundless as the sea.\nMy love as deep. The more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite"\nJuliet\'s use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo\'s: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That\'s passion!\nJuliet\'s Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.\nLove - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in \'love at first sight\'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn\'t really know what true love was until he met Juliet.\nJuliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!\nTime - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.\nShe says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.\nRomeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.\nRomeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?\nRomeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: \'sun\', \'stars\' \'brightness\'.\nRomeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.\nWhen Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is.

Look for original phrases instead.\nHow could you improve the following sentences?\n1) He was scared out of his skin.\n2) The trees danced in the breeze.\n3) She felt that her heart would break.\n1) He felt his fingers uncontrollably tighten and clench together so that his nails dug deep into his palms.\n2)The wind gradually got stronger and they could see the leaves on the top branches swirling rhythmically, rising and falling.\n3) She knew that she wouldn\'t be able to speak or even look at him, and she kept blinking back the tears.\nHopefully, you\'ll find these second versions more accurate, creative and involving.

{'text': '> Atmosphere and setting - Test Bite\nRay, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can\'t hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend\'s mum.\nAnswer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.\nHe hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.\n"Let\'s go downstairs. I don\'t like the smoke." Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. "Yeah".\n"This\'ll do," she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.\nMrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.\nWhat kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?\nRay\'s thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus\nhow the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.\nIn this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray\'s thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to \'prevent him getting on\' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.\nAs the conductor approaches, Ray\'s fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face \'bent low\' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things \'with a total clarity\'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels \'dismay\'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.\nThe writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase \'groping wildly for some excuse\' shows Ray\'s panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the \'heaviness\' of the conductor\'s uniform, and wonders if he was \'wearing heavy boots as well\' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself \'Could he offer to pay her fare?\'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray\'s fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.\nMore from Atmosphere and setting - Test Bite:\nWhat does it all mean? Find out with this activity.\nLove books?

First we'll see how respiration works, and then look at how plants use respiration in combination with photosynthesis.\nis the chemical reaction used to release energy from glucose. It is called aerobic because oxygen from the air is also needed.\nHere is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:\nNotice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.\nPlant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.\nAs we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.\nSo what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.\nPlants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.\nNeither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out\nPhotosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.\nPlants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.\nHungry for knowledge?

{'text': 'The extract below is about zombies. Note down your answers to the questions that follow and then check them against ours.\n"The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, "Great God, maybe this stuff really is true...".\nThis is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti.\nThe zombie\'s fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition.\nNeither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that "misty zone that divides life from death". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land.\nFrom \'The Book of Great Mysteries\' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans.\nQ1. The writer chooses to begin the extract with a story based on someone\'s actual experience. Why do you think he did this?\nQ2. What is the effect of the two short sentences which open the extract?\nQ3. In the third sentence, why does the speaker use a list of three adjectives to describe the zombie\'s eyes?\nQ4. Why did Seabrook believe for a moment that he had met a real zombie?\nQ5. Which words tell you he did not really believe this?\nQ6. In the second paragraph, how does the writer use language to convince us that the zombie is a terrifying creature?\nQ7. Which other creatures are compared to the zombie in the third paragraph?\nQ8. Give two reasons why the zombie\'s fate is described as "even worse".\nQ9. What is the purpose of this text?\nA1. They did this to make the whole text sound more believable, and to add lively detail to the factual section which follows it.\nA3. They help the reader to build up a picture of the zombie, making the writing more dramatic.\nA4. He had seen \'so much previously in Haiti that was outside normal experience\' that he thought it might be a real zombie.\nA5. The words which tell us he didn\'t really believe this are: \'for a flash of a second\', \'panicky lapse\' and \'maybe\'.\nA6. The writer uses the phrase \'one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural\'. You might also have picked out the phrase \'walking corpse\'.\nA7. Zombies are compared to vampires and werewolves.\nA8. The zombie\'s fate is worse because it can\'t think, it can\'t return to human form, it is doomed to slave labour and it has no memory of its home or loved ones.\nA9. The text has two purposes: firstly, to inform us about zombies, and secondly, to entertain.\nMore from Writer\'s tricks - Test Bite:\nUse your knowledge to help Spherox find his way home.\nMore than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

{'text': 'Morphine is a powerful painkilling drug that acts directly on the central nervous system. It is called an opiate because it comes from the opium poppy. It is prescribed to relieve severe chronic pain, such as cancer pain, and after severe injury or surgery. Morphine has side effects such as drowsiness and blurred vision, and it is very addictive.\nHeroin is manufactured from morphine and is even more dangerously addictive. But it is useful to treat severe pain in terminally ill patients, and it causes fewer unpleasant side effects than morphine. Both substances are used illegally as recreational drugs, and this is very dangerous.\nCannabis is an illegal drug that can be smoked, producing feelings of well-being. But like tobacco it can cause lung cancer and bronchitis. Unlike tobacco, it can cause permanent damage to the mental health of its users. Research has shown that cannabis has some useful painkilling properties, but it is illegal to prescribe it for this use.\nAll drugs have the potential to damage our health, because they change chemical processes in the body. Addictive recreational drugs may damage our health indirectly by reducing the amount of money available to buy food, and by placing users in dangerous situations. Injecting any drug with a needle and syringe that someone else has used may lead to a number of diseases from infected blood, including HIV and hepatitis. Users of illegal drugs may turn to crime to pay for their habit, and this affects the lives of other people.\nA research report in 2006 classified various drugs according to their health and social risks, without reference to whether they are legal or not. In the report, heroin and cocaine are the most dangerous two drugs, alcohol is the fifth most dangerous and tobacco is ninth.\nLosing your way?

Shelley makes it clear the Monster is one of many such victims. She wanted her audience to think about the injustices in her world, and perhaps do something about them.\nThe Monster suffers right from the start with Victor's flight from it, deserting his responsibilities as a 'father'. People in the 19th century would have seen this as a crime. Victor is punished with death by the novel's end.\nBut the Monster is also responsible for some terrible crimes, especially the murder of Elizabeth. It punishes itself by committing suicide. However, if people had been kinder, or at least less cruel, the Monster would have found acceptance and felt no need to exact revenge on a world it believed to be responsible for its\nA difficult or unfortunate state or situation.\nShelley, like her mother, was a firm believer in social justice: that we should look after everyone from all ranks of society, regardless of wealth or status. Perhaps it should not be a surprise, then, that the fairest, most decent characters are women. But they are punished by fate, a cruel God, the Monster or (ironically) the system of justice itself.\nVictor's mother shows kindness in firstly taking in Elizabeth, then taking care of her when she falls ill with scarlet fever. An injustice is done to her, though, when she dies of the same disease after coaxing Elizabeth to a full recovery. Elizabeth then acts as a mother to the remaining family, marries her livelong love, Victor, but is punished with death at the hands of the Monster.\nJustine is a caring servant and loving guardian of William who unreasonably feels responsible when he is murdered. Her execution as a result of a forced conviction and unfair judge is a further example of the many injustices Shelley saw in the world around her. It is also ironic that the judicial system saves Victor when on trial for the murder of Clerval, when he is the guiltiest character in the story.

For instance, we find out he lives with his daughter and her family, and how important his pigeons are to him.\nLessing also writes the story mainly from his point of view. For instance, we are told his thoughts, such as thinking about how his other granddaughters were 'transformed' by marriage and became 'serious young matrons' rather than girls who doted on their grandfather. In this way, the old man is shown to be rather selfish - he is thinking more about himself than the happiness of others in his family. This is most clearly shown when he asks his daughter about Alice and if they can 'keep her a bit longer'.\nThis is a good start - it keeps to the point and does not waste time retelling the entire story. It also includes short examples to make each point clearer.\nThe word 'keeping' might strike us as rather odd, because it is usually reserved for animals, not your children or grandchildren. However, Lessing draws several comparisons between particular characters and animals, in particular the pigeons. I especially liked the old man's fingers 'curling like claws into his palms', because it made me think he was becoming just like his birds. It also indicates that his quiet rage is building up as he starts to speak to Alice.\nAlice seems to be the one the old man loves the most, but also despises. At times he is very rude to her, even calling her an 'impudent little bit of rubbish'. Yet it is obvious to me that he loves her deeply and can hardly bear to see her leave. For instance, he almost instantly regrets being rude to her, and starts to cry when he learns she is going to marry Steven.\nLessing seems to use contrasts like this throughout the story. For example, the behaviour of the old man and Lucy is very effectively portrayed. The old man is angry, stamps his feet and shouts like a child, while his daughter is able to humour him, and even 'croons' like one of his pigeons to calm him down.\nThis is only the start of the task. There is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction. It continues to treat each point fairly briefly, but manages to refer to the plot, language, relationships and themes. It also includes some of the writer's personal thoughts, giving a wide-ranging and detailed discussion of how the old man is presented in the story.\nGet some direction with a Bitesize revision map\nGet creative, get published and get expert writing advice at BBC Blast.\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

{'text': 'When we talk about dramatic effect, we are basically talking about how we experience the play in a theatre.\nThe first thing to bear in mind is that the play is not meant to be real, or even look real. Shakespeare makes it clear in The Prologue (at the start) that it is not a true story, rather a group of actors. He even gives away the entire plot, so we all know a couple will fall in love, then kill themselves. It does not really matter what GCSE title you are given, you could easily include something from The Prologue as relevant to the entire play - this is theatre, not real life.\nSecondly, it is important to remember how people watch a play in the theatre. We cannot stop the actors to make a cup of tea, and there is no book to put down or DVD to pause. This seems obvious, but is easy to forget.\nFor instance, as Act 3 Scene 1 closes, the bodies of Tybalt and Mercutio are still warm and Romeo is literally running for his life. Yet Shakespeare instantly switches to Juliet, sitting on her own waiting impatiently for the man she has just married. She knows nothing of what has happened, and her head is full of dreams of love. A theatre audience cannot help but feel sympathy for her. This is exactly what dramatic effect is all about - how feelings are created.\nShakespeare creates dramatic effect by switching a lot from one event to another. The switches tend to involve two things: a change in the place, from one group of characters to another, and a switch in the mood, such as from humour to violence, or violence to love.\nFor instance, the opening scene of the play is comedy. We are meant to laugh at the two servants and their crude comments about sex. However, the atmosphere changes very quickly. Other people arrive, they taunt each other, and a fight breaks out. Benvolio, Romeo\'s friend, tries to stop it, but Tybalt confronts him and they end up fighting, as do the heads of the two families. This is stopped by the arrival of the Prince of Verona, who threatens death to anyone who disobeys him by fighting.\nSo, from the start, Shakespeare gradually adds characters until the whole stage is full of fighting. He then changes the focus, as we are left with just three characters discussing Romeo. The tone also changes - we move from violence to love. We find out that Romeo is love-sick for a girl, Rosaline, who is clearly not in love with Romeo.\nWe find out more as Romeo appears on stage to talk to his friend Benvolio. So now we just have two characters. But then we switch to another conversation: Juliet\'s father talking to Paris about whether Juliet should marry him.\nEach change in the plot is deliberate. You should think about what is relevant to your task.\nOften events in the play are repeated in a similar way later on. This allows the audience to make connections and understand some of the universal themes it deals with. For instance:\n- The opening scene of the play goes from comedy to violence very quickly. It ends with The Prince of Verona judging everyone who was involved. The same thing occurs twice later on in the play. In Act 3, the Prince arrives when Tybalt has been killed and passes judgment on what has happened. And in Act 5 he does the same thing when Juliet is found dead.\n- The start of the feud between the two families was seen by the Prince as a very minor matter. But it had led to deaths in the past, and there are a number of other accidents which cause death in the play. Mercutio dies because of Romeo\'s actions; Tybalt dies even though Romeo does not really want to kill him. However, the most obvious of the accidents is when the Friar cannot get his message to Romeo, and that leads to the deaths of Paris, Romeo and Juliet.\n. This basic theme is summed up in line 166, Act 1, Scene 1: \'Here\'s much to do with hate, but more with love.\' The two topics are even included in the same breath, as Romeo talks of "loving hate".\nThis is echoed in the structure of the play. For instance, as soon as Romeo is alone with Juliet in the orchard, we are reminded several times of the danger he is in. Love seems to be linked to hatred throughout.\nElsewhere, the play mixes the two aspects for dramatic effect. In Act 2, Scene 4, Romeo is described as \'dead\' and \'stabbed\', but due to love, not hatred.\nThe scene at Juliet\'s tomb shows just how well Shakespeare can switch the mood for his audience. It is worthwhile having a look at this in a little more detail...\nA number of things take place at the tomb where Juliet has been placed:\nParis arrives to mourn his bride, his \'sweet flower\'. Then Romeo arrives, determined to open the tomb and then kill himself. Paris sees Romeo, wants to protect the bodies, so challenges him, but is killed.\nAs Paris dies, he calls out: \'Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet\'. This is exactly what Romeo had planned for himself, but he obliges anyway. He then finds Juliet\'s body and is overcome by her beauty, despite remembering that the body of Tybalt, who he had killed previously, is somewhere in the tomb lying in a \'bloody sheet\'.\nRomeo then drinks the poison. Suddenly, the action switches to show the Friar on his way to rescue Juliet. When he arrives, Juliet refuses to be saved and kills herself, just before the Watch and the Prince arrive.\nThese incidents happen at an alarming rate. They serve to tie up a number of loose ends, as well as take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster. The structure is deliberate. Shakespeare is not simply telling a story; he is showing how characters relate to each other, and how seemingly minor incidents led to tragedy. Whatever task you have been set, you should aim to include something about the dramatic effects created in\n, because they reflect how an audience experiences the play in a theatre.\n', 'label': '5'}

These can have serious consequences.\nA false positive occurs when a genetic test has wrongly detected a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family could believe something is wrong when it is not. This may lead them to decide not to start a family, or to choose an abortion, in order to avoid having a baby with a genetic disorder.\nA false negative happens when a genetic test has failed to detect a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family would be wrongly reassured. This may lead them to decide to start a family or continue with a pregnancy.\nGene therapy involves inserting copies of a normal\nOne of the rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA).\nof an individual who carries a faulty allele.

Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.\nIdentify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?\nIdentify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.\nRead on if you are taking the\nIdeas about science - values - higher\nSome people believe employers should have access to our genetic profile when we apply for a job.

They could use this information to see how long we are expected to live, and maybe either refuse to give us insurance or only provide it at an increased cost.\nfrom 2007 about a company offering genetic testing for around £1,000.\nBoth of these are examples of values that science cannot address.

Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new varieties of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species. The characteristics of a species can be used to classify the species. This is sometimes difficult to do.\nGenetic engineering is also called genetic modification (or\n). It is not the same as cloning. Although cloning techniques are used in genetic engineering, the two things should not be confused.\nThe table shows some of the differences.\nCertain enzymes can cut pieces of DNA containing a particular gene from one organism, and join them into a gap in the DNA of another organism. This means that the new organism with the inserted genes has the genetic information for one or more new characteristics. For example, the organism might produce a useful substance, or be able to carry out a new function. We say that the organism has been genetically modified.\nThe animation shows how the method can be used to produce bacteria that produce insulin.

The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.\nOver time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.\nSelective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.\nFor example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties (or breeds) - they may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs.\nFrom left to right - Beagle, Wheaten Terrier, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Red Siberian Husky, Irish Setter, Golden Retriever, Boxer, Sheltie\nSuppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk.

For example, we may wish to produce a variety of cow capable of producing a lot of milk, or a bacteriumcapable of producing insulin.\nThere is no goal in natural selection: although we find that particular species are well adapted to their environments, natural selection does not 'know' what the species should be like. Individuals that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive to reproduce, and so pass on their characteristics to the next generation, than those that are poorly suited.\nYou will remember from your Key Stage 3 studies that species with similar characteristics are put into groups, and that this is called classification.

{'text': 'Named after the main character in a piece of work.\nheroine of the novel and all of the other characters are seen through her eyes. Characters such as Bertha Mason who are not seen by Jane are not encountered by the reader either.\nJane is the main character, and the story is told through her eyes. She is a strong character with a well developed sense of what is right. When she is small, this is revealed as a strong sense of injustice, which leads to the fight with John Reed and the final breakdown of her relationship with Mrs Reed.\nBecause the story is told through her eyes, we are allowed to fully understand the development of her emotions. Probably one of the most powerful scenes in the book is when she is with the dying Helen Burns. Helen\'s resignation and acceptance, combined with her religious faith, and the admirable role model of Miss Temple, are the big positives of Jane\'s time in Lowood.\nPerhaps one of the most attractive things about Jane is that she is not a\nA person regarded as self-righteous and arrogant.\n. She allows her feelings full vent. She resents Blanche because she loves Rochester so much, although that does not stop her from behaving as she should. But there comes a moment when she simply responds to emotion, when she is close to accepting St John Rivers: "I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the question, and thought only of duty." (Chapter 35.) It is at that point that she hears Rochester calling her from far away. While at the point of accepting St John, she appealed to Heaven for guidance, and the outcome was to send her back to Rochester.\nOur close relationship with Jane is an important element of the book. Remember the opening of the last chapter. Possibly the most famous line in the book emphasises our close relationship with the heroine: "Reader, I married him." (Chapter 38.)\nWhy does Mr Rochester marry Bertha Mason? In part, it is because he believes he is marrying an attractive woman. In part, it is to oblige his family by making a good marriage financially speaking. And in part it is because his father and brother, and Bertha\'s relatives, kept the madness in her family from him. While Rochester blames himself for falling for Bertha\'s superficial charm, he cannot forgive the betrayal of the deception. Even after his brother and father die, he is still trapped by the situation.\nIt is clear that he tries to hide from the reality of it, but when he meets Jane he sees her as extraordinarily different and refreshing. He falls deeply in love, but does not have the courage to tell her. He admits, after Mason has stopped the wedding, that he wanted to have her "safe" first, knowing her moral stance as he does. The fact that he was prepared to deceive her, even after his own experience, might suggest he needs a period of\nbefore the happy ending. What is never in any doubt is how much he loves Jane:\n"Oh, Jane! my hope - my love - my life!" (Chapter 27.)\nThere are, of course, a lot of other characters in the book. The best way to deal with them, given that the story is told from Jane\'s point of view, is to look at what they mean to her. This would be a good starting point in any character study.\nAdmirable role models: Helen Burns, Miss Temple.\nCruel, negative, but ultimately to be resisted: John Reed, Mr Brocklehurst; or outgrown: Mrs Reed.\nPositive characters: Bessie, Mr Lloyd, Hannah, some of the students at the village school, the good-natured farmer who gave her food when starving.\nNegative or weak, but lesser figures: some of the teachers at Lowood, Abbot.\nNegative pictures of the wealthy: Blanche Ingram and her mother, Mr Brocklehurst\'s family, Georgiana Reed.\nWarm, positive characters: Diana and Mary Rivers, Rosamond and Mr Oliver.\nObsessive and emotionally restricted people, though with a certain charisma: Eliza Reed, St John Rivers.\nSome of these characters represent challenges in Jane\'s journey through life.

{'text': "Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other\nPeople draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example:\nreligious leaders and the official teaching of their religion\nThere are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make – absolute morality and relative moraility.\nIf you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age.\nHow would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances.\nIf you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations.\nHow would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped.\nContraception or ‘birth control’ is used for a variety of reasons:\nwhen pregnancy might harm the mental or physical condition of the mother\nto limit the number of children people have to ensure they don't damage living standards or affect other children\nto prevent pregnancy in people who do not want a child at this stage in their lives\nContraception, including artificial contraception, is permitted in Judaism in appropriate circumstances.\nReform and Liberal schools of Judaism allow birth control for a wide range of reasons. Orthodox Judaism is more restrictive.\nThe methods of contraception allowed under Jewish law are those that do not damage the sperm or stop it getting to its intended destination. These are the contraceptive pill and the IUD.\nJudaism teaches that life is a sacred gift from God:\nThen God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.”\nSexual intercourse is seen as an important part of marriage. It is part of a husband’s duty and a woman’s rights. Judaism is generally opposed to contraception because of teachings such as:\nHe who fashioned and made the earth… he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited…\nGod blessed them and said to them, ‘Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.’\nContraceptives are also thought to interfere with the physical union between a man and a woman:\nFor this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.\nOn the other hand any restriction on the use of contraceptives can be lifted if the mother’s life is at risk in any way.\nAbortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.\nAn abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:\nthe life or physical health of the mother is at risk\nthe mental health of the mother is at risk\nthere is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled\nWhere the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.\nIn 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700.\nIn Judaism, abortion is thought to be worse than\nBirth control; actions, devices or medication intended to prevent conception.\nbecause it interferes with a potential life. However there are instances when it is permitted, particularly when the life of the mother is at risk. The decision must be taken by the mother. The later in the pregnancy, the more difficult it is to approve of an abortion.\nIt is clear that the life of the mother is more important than that of an unborn child:\nIf men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life.\nYour web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

{'text': "All products have a limited life both for the consumer and the producer.\nThis Revision Bite will help you understand what the product life-cycle is and why it is important in marketing.\nWhen we buy a product we need to know how long it will last. Perishable goods, like fruit and vegetables, have a short lifespan. Durables like a car have a longer lifespan. Different products last for different lengths of time but their life-cycles have elements in common and follow this curve:\nThe product is tested and developed before it is launched. Initial sales will be low until the consumer starts buying. At this point, production costs are much higher than the revenue from sales.\nAs sales increase production becomes more profitable. The early development costs can be recovered. The success of the product can lead to\nChoosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand.\nCustomers returning to buy from the same business.\nThe product reaches its peak of sale and is at its most profitable point for the company. Competitors have now entered the market which may reach\nWhen the market is full of similar products it becomes difficult for a product to make additional profits.\nAs new models and designs come out, or fashions change, a product may become\nA product that is outdated or one which has been replaced by another.\n. Sales fall, as does revenue. It is no longer profitable to produce it.\nApplying the product life cycle to the marketing mix\nMarketing teams watch for changes in the business environment and react to them. They respond to consumer needs, the actions of competitors or government and use the following strategies during each stage of the product life cycle.\nTo make the target market aware of the new product it is important to heavily\nuse advertising and publicity to increase the sales of a product\nThis is usually a one-off price which is used as a promotionary tactic to gain customers attention and so to increase sales. Later the price will rise.\nAs sales and profitability increase, the selling price may be reduced to make the product more attractive. Continued advertising around the brand name will help to sustain sales. The marketing team may consider expanding its distribution, to reach more consumers.\nCompetitors will usually have entered the market at this stage. If their products are as good but cheaper the company may lose some of its market share. The pricing strategy must be reviewed. Marketers may also put\nonto their product, by offering accessories or insurance, for example.\nMarketing cannot save a product at this stage, but targeting a different and smaller segment can prolong its life.\nHard PC, a computer engineering company, has developed a new processor that is ten times more powerful than existing ones. Their product has sold very well, but is now passing from its growth stage into its maturity stage. Competitors have already entered the market. As a member of their marketing team, suggest two promotional activities Hard PC might use. Give your reasons.\nWhen you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.\nMost exam questions in this subject are based on a case study that provides a setting for business theory. Look carefully at your case study to see what information is given about the product life-cycle. Think about the different stages and the marketing strategies that can be used.\nWe need to promote our product. I would suggest that we offer free accessories to increase sales. We could also try advertising our new promotion.\nJill's answer shows the right kind of promotional activities for this situation but not the reasons for them. This kind of promotion would not necessarily be used to 'increase sales'. She has also only given one reason. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.\nThere is a lot of competition so we need to promote our product. I would suggest that we offer free accessories. This would make our product more attractive than our competitors' products. We could also try advertising to remind consumers about our brand and the new promotion we have on offer. This might encourage more sales.\nLuke's answer showed he understood the subject, and his reasons were good. He could have been more thorough, and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.\nThe market will soon reach saturation point because of competition. We therefore need to promote our product to lengthen its life. I would suggest that we try to add value to our product by offering free accessories. This is because we want consumers to find our product more attractive than our competitors' products. We could also try advertising to remind consumers about the existence of our brand and the new promotion we will have on offer. We may already have developed some brand loyalty amongst our customers so this might encourage repeat sales.\nTess's answer was very detailed, and she was able to apply her knowledge of business to the case study. She was able to use the correct terms, like saturation point, add value, brand loyalty. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.\n", 'label': '5'}

Shakespeare cleverly uses loyalty as a dramatic device as well - Duncan is in the middle of talking about 'absolute trust' when Macbeth walks in - we know he's already thought about killing Duncan, but for the moment he talks about 'the loyalty I owe' and his 'duties' to Duncan.\nLoyalty is also very important to Banquo - he will not desert Duncan. Macbeth, however, has an odd idea of loyalty - he knows he is doing the wrong thing, but he still goes ahead. Early on in the play perhaps it is his wife who is manipulating him, but later on it is Macbeth who makes the decisions. And later on he also starts to show he hates disloyalty, threatening his messengers and servants.\n- he is unsure before the murder and regrets it immediately after. Lady Macbeth is the opposite - she seems to show no guilt at the time and even talks about how 'a little water' cleans away the blood.

This is the cause of the friction in his own marriage and the dispute with Rodolpho and Marco.\nThe play shows us that love is not always beautiful - it is responsible for all the\nbetween the characters. It is a deep passion that can create jealousy and cause pain both to the person who loves, the person who is loved and those around them. For Eddie, love also causes conflict within himself when he cannot admit to his illicit love for Catherine.\nWhat do you imagine happens to the lovers Catherine and Rodolpho at the end of the play?

The written law may not always act in favour of justice yet it is better to follow the law than to take it into your own hands. In the play we see that Eddie betrays Marco and Rodolpho, there is no law to punish Eddie so Marco takes the law into his own hands, the play ends with a fight to the death. Alfieri reiterates his beliefs at the end of the play:\n"Most of the time now we settle for half and I like it better."\nAlfieri values the law more than justice, he sees that when people go against the law to assert justice it can lead to\nThe play encourages us to ask what is justice? What makes justice? Both Eddie and Marco have strong ideas of what is \'just\' and are prepared to go to great lengths to achieve it. The characters often mistake their own desires for justice, they fail to look for a higher principle of justice seperate from their own feelings, this is what leads to conflict.\nHere are some more instances in the play when\nThe story of Vinny Bolzano is an example of how someone obeying the law (as Vinny technically was when he informed on his uncle) is actually doing something unjust. Do you think the treatment of Vinny by his relations was just?\nAlfieri tries to warn Eddie about his relationship with Catherine and argues with him to allow her to marry Rodolpho.\nWhen the law is wrong it\'s because it\'s unnatural, but in this case it is natural and a river will drown you if you buck it now.\nHe is suggesting that it is Eddie\'s feelings for Catherine that are \'unnatural\'.\nEddie makes recourse to the law that he spurned when he telephones the Immigration Bureau. Eddie has no fixed principle of justice, his feelings dictate what he believes to be \'just\'.\nAlfieri tries to make Marco realise who is the real \'judge\' of events - God.\nBoth Eddie and Marco allow their personal feelings to affect their idea of justice.

Eddie is clear that Vinny will never be seen in the neighbourhood again out of shame:\n"a guy do a thing like that? How\'s he gonna show his face?"\nFamily comes first. To betray one\'s family is a crime and should be punished - Vinny gets no sympathy despite the injuries inflicted upon him: it was seen that he got what he deserved.

It means far more to them than the law. To be honourable is to be respected. If you do anything dishonourable, you lose respect. That is why Marco and Eddie are so keen to protect their names and get a \'just\' conclusion. Codes of honour bind families and the whole neighbourhood with a sense of community. Everyone should look out for one another, to betray someone is the most dishonourable action imaginable.\nHere are some examples of how honour works in the play:\n"It\'s an honour, B.

Alfieri tries to persuade him otherwise:\n"To promise not to kill is not dishonourable"\n- but Marco\'s sense of honour it too strong. (It is interesting that Marco had given Alfieri his word that he would not harm Eddie, yet then does so: clearly, Marco\'s need for revenge is stronger than any fear about breaking a promise.\nEddie, however, blindly refuses to believe that he has done anything wrong. He desperately wants to get back his good name after Marco\'s accusations caused the neighbourhood to turn away from him.\nMarco\'s got my name - and you run tell him, kid, that he\'s gonna give it back to me in front of this neighbourhood, or we have it out.\nDo you think that Eddie dies an \'honourable\' death?

The amount of mains electrical energy transferred is measured in kilowatt-hours, kWh.

To convert from W to kW you must divide by 1000.\nFor example, 2000W = 2000 ÷ 1000 = 2kW.\nAlso note that time is measured in hours here, instead of the more usual seconds. To convert from seconds to hours you must divide by 3600.\nFor example, 1800s = 1800 ÷ 3600 = 0.5 hours.\nElectricity meters measure the number of units of electricity used in a home or other building. The more units used, the greater the cost. The cost of the electricity used is calculated using this equation:\ntotal cost = number of units × cost per unit\nFor example, if 5 units of electricity are used at a cost of 8p per unit, the total cost will be 5 × 8 = 40p.\nCheck your understanding of working out the cost of electricity by having a go at this activity.\nYour web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

{'text': "The popularity of Much Ado About Nothing\nis one of Shakespeare's best-known plays. There are all sorts of reasons for this, but perhaps the main one is that the basic story still strikes a chord with modern audiences.\nThe play is all about relationships between the sexes, and we meet two very different couples. One is exactly as we would expect a couple to be: they fall in love almost at first sight and appear ideally suited to each other. However, the man appears to be quite shallow and believes his wife-to-be has cheated on him. He leaves her, but is tricked into marrying her later on.\nThe second couple are not together as a couple at all. They spend most of their time insulting each other, and both swear they will never marry. However, their friends trick them into falling in love, which they do, and they get ready to marry at the end. One of the most interesting ideas in the play is that the traditional couple are perhaps not really in love, but the odd couple are.\nThe play contains two basic ideas which have been used in all sorts of films and stories. The first is that a couple have to overcome numerous obstacles before they can find true love. The second is that two very different people who start off arguing later fall in love, and everything ends happily.\nhas been filmed a number of times and adapted for stage in all sorts of ways.

{'text': "For the D201 project, you are likely to have to produce two of the three types of screen-based publications - websites, information points and presentations.\nYou will probably be familiar with websites and presentations, but you might have to do a bit more investigation to find examples of information points.\nSpend a bit of time investigating screen-based publications and note what makes them effective - or not!\nA woman using a public information point: You might be asked to produce an on-screen publication for an information point\nThe crucial thing is to make sure that each publication you make is suitable for the intended purpose and audience.\nAs with other publications in the D201 course, you don’t have to worry too much about using all the advanced features of the piece of software you are using. The exam board is much more keen to see that you have thought about what you are doing and have produced a suitable solution. This will involve careful planning, testing and modifying of each product you develop.\nPlanning is a crucial stage in the development of screen-based media. The exam board may ask you to include evidence of your plan in your eportfolio. Look carefully at the\nto see if the planning stage has a tick next to it. If it does, it means you must include it in your project and it is probably worth spending a bit more time on it.\nThe standard ways of planning screen-based media are storyboards and navigation charts.\nYou could do the storyboard or navigation chart on paper, or onto a computer using different types of software. If you do it on paper, you may need to scan it in to get it onto your eportfolio.\nOther things to think about as part of your planning:\nSize and file format of your publication.\nPresentations and websites can get quite big if you start including lots of graphic and media files. Check carefully to see how much memory you are allowed to use.\nWebpages (htm) and Powerpoint files are normally permitted file types.\nIf you are using another type of software, make sure you are able to convert it into one of the allowed file types.\nFiles types allowed are listed in the\nA storyboard shows each stage you want to have on screen, one after the other. You would normally use a storyboard if there is just a single pathway through your product – for example, a simple slideshow that starts at Slide 1 and goes through to the end.\nYou can include pictures, text and descriptions to explain what you are trying to achieve. For example, you might want to describe some sound or music that you want to have, or the transition you would like to have between slides.\nBelow is an example of a storyboard for a School Parents' Evening presentation.\nThe more detail you include, the easier you will find it when you come to make the actual product.\nYour finished version does not have to be exactly the same as your original design:\nSometimes you will find better ways of doing something. For example, you may not be able to find the precise image you intended to use.\nDon't worry about changes. The storyboard is just a plan to guide you through the process. You will not lose marks for changes.\nUse your evaluation section to explain the differences between the storyboard plan and final version. Don't forget to include reasons why changes were made.\nA navigation chart is used when there is potentially more than one way to navigate through your product. For example, on a website each user may want to visit pages in a different order and on an information point, the user may want to view some sections and not others.\nA navigation chart starts with the main welcome screen or home page at the top and then shows the different ways a user can access the various parts of the product. There is no compulsory way of doing this. What is important is that you show you have thought about the best way to structure your product and how you are making it suitable for the intended audience.\nIn general, a navigation chart will contain less detail than a storyboard. A storyboard shows what each screen will look like, but a navigation chart shows the possible pathways between the screens. For the products you are producing, it may be sensible to put a bit more detail on your navigation charts, so that you have a design for each page you hope to produce.\nAdd notes to your diagram to explain exactly what you are trying to achieve. Explain the reasons for the choices you have made.\nAn information point is a set of screens that provide information on a particularly topic. You've probably seen information points in stations, airports, museums and places or interest.\nMake sure your Index page has links to all content.\nWhen you're designing an information point, it must be possible for the user to navigate to the information they want without having to scroll through all the other information. There must be a menu that provides links to all information.\nThis can be done in a Powerpoint-type slide show or by making a set of webpages. What you choose to use is up to you.

There is no difference between the world of humans and the world of nature. Both of these are equally important and must be treated with respect.\nThe Gurus have strongly made us aware of our responsibility towards this earth.\nSikhs believe that the environment can only be preserved if the balance created by Waheguru is maintained.\nIn 1986, HRH Prince Philip, then President of the WWF International invited five leaders of five of the major religions of the world -\n- to meet to discuss how their faiths could help\nThe meeting took place in Assisi in Italy, because it was the birth place of St Francis, the Catholic saint of ecology. From this meeting arose key statements by the five faiths outlining their own distinctive traditions and approach to the care for nature.\nIn the Assisi Declarations on Nature the Sikh statement was:\nSince the beginning of the Sikh religion in the late fifteenth century, the faith has been built upon the message of the ‘oneness of Creation’. Sikhism believes an almighty God created the universe. He himself is the creator and master of all forms of the universe, responsible for all modes of nature and all elements of the world. Sikhism firmly believes God to be the source of the birth, life and death of all things.\nSikhism teaches that the natural environment and the survival of all life forms are closely linked in the rhythm of nature. The history of the Gurus is full of stories of their love and special relationship with the natural environment-, with animals, birds, vegetation, earth, rivers, mountains and the sky. There is also a very strong vegetation tradition.\nIt is for this reason that in Sikhism those who kill for lust of hunting, eating or to make sacrifices are condemned.

{'text': 'Discussing themes in your work shows that you are no longer just thinking about Hamlet as if it was a true story. Instead you are looking at the play and thinking about Shakespeare\'s choices. The four main themes in Hamlet are revenge, madness, deception and family and sexuality.\nLaertes challenges Hamlet to a duel to avenge his father\'s death\nis the initial motivation for Hamlet\'s transformation into anger and madness.\nIn Shakespeare\'s time, "Revenge Tragedies" were a popular form of entertainment for theatre goers. The Bible explicitly\nrevenge but human instinct often wants it.\nHamlet strongly desires revenge for his father\'s murder, but other concerns cloud the issue. For example, Hamlet has the chance to kill Claudius when he finds him apparently knelt in prayer. Hamlet hesitates because he fears that if Claudius dies while he is praying, he might go to heaven. Hamlet is determined that Claudius should go to hell for his betrayal and deception.\nabout the nature of the old King\'s death also confuses the matter. Hamlet feels unable to take revenge unless he is absolutely sure of Claudius\' guilt. Hamlet fears that the Ghost is not his father but an evil spirit sent to tempt him to Hell.\nLaertes\' sense of revenge is much stronger than Hamlet\'s and Shakespeare\nthe two. Laertes does not need to be convinced of Hamlet\'s guilt to take revenge. On hearing Hamlet\'s explanation for Polonius\' death, Laertes declares that he is\n. By this he means that he understands Hamlet\'s actions, but it does not stop him from fighting Hamlet in a duel with a poisoned and sharpened sword.\nAfter speaking to the Ghost, Hamlet decides to\n, meaning he is going to feign\nHamlet hopes that by pretending to be mad, he will be able to study the King\'s behaviour without arousing suspicion. Ironically, Claudius declares that\n"madness in great ones must not unwatched go"\nand Hamlet ends up being more closely watched than ever.\nHamlet\'s apparent madness also has the effect of\nhimself. Ophelia, in particular, suffers from this. She was once loved by Hamlet, but in his madness he frightens her and claims not to have ever loved her. There are different reasons why Hamlet may have done this:\nHis mother\'s unfaithfulness and incest could have caused him to lose trust in all relationships. His treatment of Ophelia is perhaps a sincere attempt to persuade her against marriage (\nOr perhaps Hamlet wants to remove any love from his own life to be in the right frame of mind to kill Claudius.\nOphelia is driven mad during the play\n. As a loyal daughter and would-be wife, the loss of her father and lover prove too much and she descends into madness. Perhaps Shakespeare wants to show the effects of a corrupt, disordered world on a pure and innocent soul. Some critics suggest that Ophelia\'s madness is a result of the pressure on a woman in a male-dominated world.\nboth have been apparently spurned by a loved one.\nOphelia, however, doesn\'t have the intellectual capacity to understand the corruption around her and she suffers terribly as a result.\nHamlet decides to pretend he is mad\nDeception causes many of the play\'s events. Claudius claims the throne from the old King by\nHis position is therefore false and this is what spurs Hamlet to seek revenge. However, the audience\'s knowledge of this murder comes from the spirit of the old King - and it is possible that the Ghost is\nof deception. He secretly desires revenge, and plots and schemes behind others\' backs. He feigns madness and puts on a play for the purpose of trapping Claudius.\nAs well as hiding his murder of the old King, Claudius is deceitful on other occasions:\nHe sends for Hamlet\'s friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to spy on his stepson and discover what he knows about the murder of the old King.\nAlso, he sends a letter to the English court to ask them to execute Hamlet.\nFinally, he plots with Laertes to poison Hamlet.\nNone of these acts of deception result in what the characters intend.\nHamlet\'s madness causes his beloved Ophelia\'s suicide.\nClaudius\' poison ends up killing Laertes, Gertrude and himself.\nHamlet is disgusted with his mother\'s marriage to his uncle and sees it as an act of\n. His revenge is motivated by the loss of\nOphelia is dominated by her father and brother\nwith his mother\'s infidelity. He insults her crudely and basely and fails to properly account for Claudius\' role in events. His cruel treatment of Ophelia seems to be the result of this loss of faith in his mother, rather than due to any fault on Ophelia\'s part.\nOphelia also suffers because of her family. She is\nby her brother and father, neither of whom show any interest in her true feelings.\nBoth Hamlet and Ophelia feel duty-bound to carry out their father\'s wishes and this bears heavily on them both.\n', 'label': '5'}

It is important to be able to distinguish between them so you can make an accurate judgement on what you are reading.\nOn the front page of the leaflet, there are only two statements apart from the title - "Poor Calf\'.\n"Every year, hundreds of thousands of calves like this one are separated from their mothers within four days of birth."\n"Why? To satisfy our unnatural and unhealthy taste for cow\'s milk."\n, and the other is probably an\nDon\'t make it too difficult for yourself - just think: which statement could be proved to be true, and which could not?\n"Every year, hundreds of thousands of calves like this one are separated from their mothers within four days of birth"\nWhy?

In this way, you won\'t be put off reading any further by immediately meeting an opinion you don\'t hold, but you\'ll probably be interested enough to read on.\nHow the reader responds to a non-fiction text is very important. The following techniques illustrate how the Vegan Society\'s leaflet has been designed to affect the reader\'s response.\nFacts are usually presented to readers in cold and objective language, but use of vivid or\nabout the information being given to you. This is\nDesigned to make the reader feel something strongly.\nThe fact in the first statement begins to work on your emotions.\nThis sounds an awfully big and uncomfortable number.\nUsing facts emotively softens you up for the emotive words in the opinion that come next in the article.\n"to satisfy our unnatural and unhealthy taste"\nThe use of the words \'unnatural\' and \'unhealthy\' is the\nof the author. There is no proof given in the article to back this statement up as fact.\nThe use of pictures is always important in getting a message across. Think about how effectively you may have seen them used in other campaign leaflets.\nYou can\'t really call a photograph a fact or an opinion - but the camera can sometimes lie, or at least put forward a particular point of view. Pictures are a very powerful way of stirring emotions and selling a product - just take a look at the covers of magazines next time you are in a newsagent.\nThe photo of the calf on the leaflet is\nin that it\'s of a real calf, but it\'s also\nbecause it looks sweet, appealing and frightened, and seems to be trapped in a grim little pen.\nNow that you know the power of fact and opinion separately, think about how and why you might use fact and opinion together.\nMixing fact and opinion is a very skillful way to present information to achieve a particular purpose. Think about the following statement.\n"The modern dairy cow is nothing more than a milk machine...milked 2-3 times a day."\n"The modern dairy cow is nothing more than a milk machine"\nA cow is clearly not a machine. This is an opinion expressed through very emotive language.\nThis is an uncontroversial fact and is used to support the opinion previously stated.\nNow that you know the difference between fact and opinion, we are going to look at how they can be used to form an argument.\n(leaving you to make up your own mind)\nRead the excerpt below, written by a journalist, from an article about the war on drugs. Can you spot the one sentence - the\n- which sums up what the paragraph is about?\nDrugs must be tackled at source. But what happens when a subculture becomes mainstream? People who talk about a "war on drugs" treat drug use as an alien, private minority activity that must be stamped out. Their war strategy aims to mobilise all possible social pressures and an array of agencies to isolate and destroy. Politicians, who want to appear tough on crime, are in the forefront of this process. They encourage police and schools to treat drug use - which in the majority of instances means possession of soft drugs - in a draconian, inflexibly judgmental manner. Police chiefs who advise against prosecution and teachers with doubts about expulsion are increasingly overridden.\nTopic sentences are the sentences in a non-fiction text that express the main ideas - or\n- of the text. They form the\nThe article about the war on drugs contains four core themes. Did you correctly identify the topic sentence in the paragraph that you read? It is:\n"People who talk about a \'war on drugs\' treat drug use as an alien, private, minority activity that must be stamped out."\nThe other three topic sentences from the rest of the text are:\n"The adequacy of this strategy can now be judged from yesterday\'s Institute for the Study of Drug Dependency report, Drugs Futures."\n"As the report says, what were once drug subcultures are now a mainstream part of the democratic market economy society. They have become the norm."\n"That does not make drug use right any more than the availability of tobacco or alcohol makes consumption of these substances right. But it certainly requires policymakers and enforcement agencies to adopt a more realistic approach to the changed drug experience of the modern age."\nSo what\'s left? Why not just write four sentences and leave it at that?\nWell, what\'s left are important elements of making a good argument -\nThe following techniques have been employed by the writer of the war on drugs article to form a sound argument.\nEach topic sentence is reinforced with a mixture of clarification and repetition of the main ideas. These add force to the argument to make it more powerful. This is the reinforcement in the first paragraph:\nTheir war strategy aims to mobilise all possible social pressures and an array of agencies to isolate and destroy. Politicians, who want to appear tough on crime, are in the forefront of this process. They encourage police and schools to treat drug use - which in the majority of instances means possession of soft drugs - in a draconian, inflexibly judgmental manner. Police chiefs who advise against prosecution and teachers with doubts about expulsion are increasingly overridden.\nIf you take clarification and repetition away, what\'s left is a big chunk of illustrative facts around which the whole argument is constructed - in this case, the findings of the special report, dealt with in the second paragraph:\nBased on a survey of 700 teenagers in north-west England aged from 14 to 16, it shows that for this age group the availability of drugs is a normal part of what the report calls "the leisure-pleasure landscape". The report finds that, by the age of 16, 76 per cent of the young people have been in situations where drugs were available or offered, and that 51 per cent had tried a drug at least once.\nWhen you remove the facts, all you have left is the conclusion - in this case, one that throws the argument open to debate:\nThe fact that Labour, though claiming to be modern, should adopt the completely opposite approach in its by-election propaganda in the north-west this week only goes to show how far we still have to go.\nIf you want to check how a writer makes a convincing argument:\nLook for sentences that illustrate or give facts.\nIn essay writing, the conclusion is the final paragraph(s) where an argument is summed up and the essay is brought to a suitable ending to leave a final impression on the reader.\nThere are four paragraphs in the article - corresponding to the four main stages of the argument.\nThat\'s not a coincidence. Paragraphs are there to guide you through to the main points of the argument. Use the divisions between them to divide your notes up when you do your first read-through.\nFinally, do make sure you look at the ending. This is a really useful way of helping you establish what the author\'s argument is if you find yourself getting lost in the body of the text. Here it\'s an open-ended,\n', 'label': '5'}

{'text': 'Not many people had real friends in the American West in the 1930s - it was a case of every man for himself. That is one of the reasons why the story of George and Lennie\'s unusual friendship is so poignant. They have each other. No one else in the novel is so lucky.\nHe is a small man, but has brains and a quick wit.\nHe has been a good friend to Lennie, ever since he promised Lennie\'s Aunt Clara that he would care for him. He looks after all Lennie\'s affairs, such as carrying his work card, and tries to steer him out of potential trouble.\nHe needs Lennie as a friend, not only because Lennie\'s strength helps to get them both jobs, but so as not to be lonely. His threats to leave Lennie are not really serious. He is genuinely proud of Lennie.\nHe shares a dream with Lennie to own a piece of land and is prepared to work hard to build up the money needed to buy it.\n"...with us it ain\'t like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don\'t have to sit in no bar room blowin\' in our jack \'jus because we got no place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us."\nHe is honest with people he trusts. For example, he tells Slim that he used to play tricks on Lennie when they were young, but now feels guilty about it as Lennie nearly drowned.\nHe is a big man, in contrast to his name.\nHe has limited intelligence, so he relies on George to look after him. He copies George in everything George does and trusts George completely.\n"Behind him (George) walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, with wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely."\nHe shares a dream with George to own a piece of land. Lennie\'s special job would be to tend the rabbits\nHe likes to pet soft things, like puppies and dead mice. We know this got him into trouble in Weed when he tried to feel a girl\'s soft red dress: she thought he was going to attack her.\nHe can be forgetful - George continually has to remind him about important things.\nHe is very gentle and kind, and would never harm anyone or anything deliberately.\nHe is extremely strong: he can work as well as two men at bucking barley.\nHe is often described as a child or an animal - he drinks from the pool like a horse and his huge hands are described as paws.\n(lead mule-team driver) at the ranch. He is excellent at his job.\nHe is the natural leader at the ranch. Everyone respects his views and looks up to him.\nHe has a quiet dignity: he doesn\'t need to assert himself to have authority.\n"there was a gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all talked stopped when he spoke. His authority was so great that his word was taken on any subject, be it politics or love."\nHe understands the relationship between George and Lennie. He helps George at the end and reassures George that he did the right thing.\nWe know little else about him, which gives him a slightly mysterious quality. Do you think he is too good to be true?\nCurley is the boss\'s son, so he doesn\'t need to work like the ordinary ranch hands, and he has time to kill.\nHe\'s little - so he hates big guys.\nHe is a prize-fighter and looks for opportunities for a fight.\n"He glanced coldly at George and then at Lennie. His arms gradually bent at the elbows and his hands closed into fists. He stiffened and went into a slight crouch. His glance was at once calculating and pugnacious."\nHe is newly- married and is very possessive of his wife - but he still visits brothels.\nThere is a rumour that he wears a glove filled with Vaseline to keep his hand soft for his wife.\nWe never know her name - she is merely Curley\'s \'property\' with no individual identity.\nShe is young, pretty, wears attractive clothes and curls her hair.\nShe seems flirtatious and is always hanging around the bunk-house.\nShe is lonely - there are no other women to talk to and Curley is not really interested in her.\n"What kinda harm am I doin\' to you? Seems like they ain\'t none of them cares how I gotta live. I tell you I ain\'t used to livin\' like this.

His back gives him constant pain.\nHe is the only black man around and is made to be isolated by his colour - he can\'t go into the bunk-house or socialise with the men.\nHe is always called the \'nigger\' by the men, which shows how racism is taken for granted. The men don\'t mean to insult Crooks every time they call him this, but they never think to use his name\nAll this has made him proud and aloof.\n"S\'pose you didn\'t have nobody. S\'pose you couldn\'t go into the bunk house and play rummy \'cause you were black...A guy needs somebody-to be near him....I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an\' he gets sick."\nThe only time he mixes with the ranch hands socially is when they pitch horseshoes - and then he beats everyone!\nHe has his own room near the stables and has a few possessions. He has books, which show he is intelligent and an old copy of the California Civil Code, which suggests he is concerned about his rights.\nHe has seen many men come and go, all dreaming of buying a piece of land, but is now cynical, as no one has ever achieved it.\nCandy is the oldest ranch hand. He lost his right hand in an accident at work.\nHe is the \'swamper\' - the man who cleans the bunkhouse. He knows he will be thrown out and put \'on the county\' when he is too old to work.\nBecause of this, he accepts what goes on and doesn\'t challenge anything: he can\'t afford to lose his job.\nHe has a very old dog, which he has had from a pup. It is his only friend and companion.\n"The old man came slowly into the room. He had his broom in his hand. And at his heels there walked a drag-footed sheep dog, gray of muzzle, and with pale, blind old eyes."\nCarlson insists on shooting the dog because he claims it is too old and ill to be of any use. Candy is devastated.\nHe is lonely and isolated, but makes friends with George and Lennie and offers his compensation money to help them all to buy a ranch together and achieve their dream.\nWhen he finds Curley\'s wife dead, he is furious, as he knows instantly that Lennie was involved and that they have lost their chance of achieving their dream.\n', 'label': '5'}

It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave.\nThe frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is common for kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) to be used when waves have very high frequencies. For example, most people cannot hear a high-pitched sound above 20kHz, radio stations broadcast\nLow frequency electromagnetic radiation used to transmit information such as television and radio programmes.\nwith frequencies of about 100MHz, while most wireless computer networks operate at 2.4GHz.\nCheck your understanding of this section by having a go at this activity.\nYour web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

{'text': "Integrated circuits are the basic component of modern\ntechnology dealing with the building of electronic circuits and devices using microchips (large numbers of extremely small integrated circuits)\nYou need to know about three types of integrated circuit that are important in controlling electronic systems. These are:\n(a circuit) having two states, one of which is stable. A monostable circuit needs to be pushed into the unstable state by a control input, and will jump back after a set time to the stable state - giving a single, timed output signal.\n(a circuit) having two states, neither of which is stable. An astable circuit therefore oscillates between the two states, giving a constant on/off digital output. Used, for example, to make LEDs flash continuously.\nIntegrated circuits are the basic component of microelectronics. ICs are complete, self-contained circuits, with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of separate components such as transistors, diodes, resistors and capacitors etched into a tiny silicon chip.\nICs have three big advantages over conventional circuits with discrete components:\nThe chip inside an IC is usually packaged inside a piece of black plastic with tiny pins protruding to allow connections to the circuit. In ICs the pins are arranged in a 'dual-in-line' (DIL) configuration, or as a surface mount chip with either eight, 14 or 16 pins. The surface mount chip is much smaller and is designed for machines to build the circuits.\nA Surface Mount package integrated circuit - far smaller than a finger-tip\nTimer circuits are used to control sequences of events in electronic systems by changing the circuit from one state to another at preset times.\nOne of the commonest integrated timer circuits is the\n, which is produced as an eight-pin DIL package containing 25 transistors, 2 diodes and 16 resistors.

You can calculate the duration of the mark and the space using the following formulae:\nMark (time on) = 0.7 x (R1 + R2) x C1\nSpace (time off) = 0.7 x R1 x C1\n- where R1 is the value of resistor R1 (in Ohms), R2 is value of resistor R2 (in Ohms) and C1 is the value of the capacitor (in microFarads)\nMonostable timers are often called one-shot timers. When the timer is switched on it will stay on for a certain length of time and then stay off until it is switched on again.\nNotice how you only need to press the switch once. The switch makes contact, then the timing process begins. The time period depends on the value of resistor R1 and capacitor C1.\nThe duration of the period is calculated using the formula:\nTime on (seconds) = 1.1 x R1 x C1\n- where R1 is the value of resistor R1 (in Ohms) and C1 is the value of the capacitor (in microFarads)\nAn astable 555 timer has the following external component values: R1 = 100 kOhms; R2 = 47 kOhms; C1 = 10 microFarads:\nMark (time on) = 0.7 x (100,000 + 47,000) x 0.00001 =\nSpace (time off) = 0.7 x 100,000 x 0.00001 =\nA monostable 555 timer has the following component values: R1 is 100 kiloOhms and C1 is 100 microFarads.

Using a temperature sensor as part of the circuitry, the op-amp is set at a particular temperature - say 20 degrees centigrade. The op-amp compares this reference temperature to the actual environmental temperature of the room, measured by a\ntype of resistor that changes resistance with temperature - also called a Temperature-Dependent Resistor. Usually the resistance decreases with an increase in temperature (and vice versa)\n. If the voltage at the non-inverting input is greater than the voltage at the inverting input the op-amp switches on the heating system.

{'text': "Darwin’s theory of evolution explains how species of living things have changed over geological time.

Many species have become extinct in the past and the extinction of species continues to happen.\nCharles Darwin was an English naturalist. He studied variation in plants and animals during a five-year voyage around the world in the 19th century. He explained his ideas about evolution in a book called\nDarwin’s ideas caused a lot of controversy, and this continues to this day, because the ideas can be seen as\nabout the creation of the world and creatures in it.\nDarwin studied the wildlife on the Galápagos Islands - a group of islands on the equator almost 1,000 kilometres west of Ecuador. He noticed that the finches - songbirds - on the different islands there were fundamentally similar to each other, but showed wide variations in their size, beaks and claws from island to island. For example, their beaks were different depending on the local food source. Darwin concluded that, because the islands are so distant from the mainland, the finches that had arrived there in the past had changed over time.\nDarwinâ\x80\x99s drawings of the different heads and beaks he found among the finches on the GalÃ¡pagos Islands\nDarwin studied hundreds more animal and plant species.

This means that their genes are less likely to be passed to the next generation. Given enough time, a species will gradually evolve.\nFossils of ammonites - sea creatures that became extinct about 65 million years ago\nMost of the evidence for evolution comes from the fossil record. Fossils show how much, or how little, organisms have changed over time. One of the problems with the fossil record is that it contains gaps. Not all organisms fossilise well, and there will be many fossils that have been destroyed by the movements of the Earth, or simply not yet been discovered.\nOne of the few animals for which we have a fairly complete evolutionary record is the horse because all the main stages of the evolution of the horse have been preserved in fossil form. Over 60 million years,\nthe horse evolved from a dog-sized creature\nthat lived in rainforests into an animal adapted to living on the plains and standing up to 2 metres high.\nfrom 2006 about the first fish to live on land.\nIn the process its multi-toed feet, that were adapted for walking across the forest floor, evolved into single-toed hooves more suited for running over open country.\nEvolution is difficult to observe because it usually takes many years to happen. This is one reason why\nthe theory of evolution is still a theory\n, not a law. Since no-one was around millions of years ago to make observations, take notes and carry out experiments,\nevolution cannot be proved in the usual scientific sense\n. However, rapid changes in species have been observed that support the theory.\nBefore the industrial revolution in Britain, most peppered moths were of the pale variety. This meant that they were camouflaged against the pale birch trees that they rest on. Moths with a mutant black colouring were easily spotted and eaten by birds. This gave the white variety an advantage, and they were more likely to survive to reproduce.\nAirborne pollution in industrial areas blackened the birch tree bark with soot. This meant that the mutant black moths were now camouflaged, while the white variety became more vulnerable to predators. This gave the black variety an advantage, and they were more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the black peppered moths became far more numerous in urban areas than the pale variety.\nThe pale peppered moths camouflage well against the pale birch tree\nThe darker mutant peppered moths camouflage well against the blackened birch tree\nE. coli bacteria (Photo from Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, NIH)\nMicroorganisms such as bacteria and viruses reproduce very rapidly and can evolve in a relatively short time.

But occasionally, the mutation is beneficial - for the bacteria. For example, it may allow resistance to an antibiotic. When that antibiotic is present, the resistant bacteria have an advantage over the bacteria that are not resistant. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are an increasing problem in hospitals.\nIndividuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will not survive and will become extinct.\nHere are some of the factors that can cause a species to become extinct:\nchanges to the environment, such as a change in climate\nmany species have become extinct since life on Earth began\n.

The plates are moving constantly, at a rate of a few centimetres each year.\nWhere tectonic plates meet, the Earth’s crust becomes unstable as the plates push against each other, or ride under or over one another. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen at the boundaries between plates.\nMagma - molten rock - is less dense than the crust. It can rise to the surface through weaknesses in the crust, forming a volcano.\nGeologists study volcanoes to try to predict future eruptions. Volcanoes can be very destructive, but some people choose to live near them because volcanic soil is very fertile. It contains minerals needed by plants for healthy growth.\nLava is the molten rock that erupts from a volcano. Some eruptions produce runny lava, while others produce thick lava that escapes violently. Igneous rocks are made when molten rock cools down and solidifies.\nIgneous rocks contain interlocking crystals. The size of the crystals depends on how quickly the molten rock cooled:\nif it cooled quickly, the crystals are small\nif it cooled slowly, the crystals are large\nThe slower the molten rock cools, the larger the crystals in the igneous rock.\nA summary of the properties of four igneous rocks and how they were formed\nBasalt is rich in iron, and rhyolite is rich in silica.\nThe mantle is the zone between the Earth’s crust and its core. It is relatively cold and rigid just below the crust. At greater depths, the mantle is able to flow because it is hot and non-rigid.\nThe theory of plate tectonics was proposed at the beginning of the last century by a German scientist named Alfred Wegener. It took more than 50 years for Wegener’s theory to be accepted. This was because it was difficult to work out the mechanism that could make whole continents move. It was not until the 1960s that enough evidence was discovered to fully support the theory.\nTectonic plates move because of convection currents in the Earth’s mantle. These are driven by the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements inside the Earth.\nOceanic plates are denser than continental plates.

Most religions offer teaching on euthanasia and the end of life.\nEuthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom but it was legalised in certain circumstances in the Netherlands in 2002 and assisted suicide was legalised in the State of Oregon (USA) in 1997.\n- the person concerned asks someone to help them die, perhaps by asking for help to take an overdose of painkillers\n- euthanasia is carried out without the patientâ€™s consent, for example, if they are in a persistent vegetative state and no longer able to live without a lifesupport machine, which is then switched off\nRemember that a person's decision to take their own life is known as 'suicide'.\nOld age and wisdom command the greatest respect in Hinduism and it is considered to be part of\n(duty) to honour, respect and care for elderly relatives.\nA man commands respect through his education, religious action, age, friends and wealth.\nPeople must be cared for until they die. Although Hindus have no religious objection to life-support machines, death is seen as a door into the next rebirth.\nAnd as a goldsmith takes the gold from an old piece of jewellery and shapes it into a more modern piece, so the Self forgets the old body, takes hold of another body, whether like that of the fathers, or of the celestial singers, or of the gods, or of the begetter, or of any other creature.\nHindus believe that all of life is sacred so they\n(respect for life) means that it's always considered wrong to take life even if someone is ill or in pain.

The suffering has to be endured or the bad\nwill be carried forward into the next life.\nA Hindu who is very old or very ill may decide for themselves that the right time has come for death by choosing to stop eating or drinking. This act of renouncing the world shows that the Hindu realises that the world is not as important as it appears. This method of choosing death is often admired as a sign of great holiness.\nThe suicide of people who take their own lives because they are depressed or feel hopeless is not acceptable to Hindus, unless they took their lives as self-sacrifice or because they cannot live without someone who has just died.\n", 'label': '5'}

{'text': 'Carol Ann Duffy was born in Glasgow in 1955. She moved to Staffordshire as a child with her family. After graduating in philosophy from Liverpool University, she became a full-time writer. Although her first works were published when she was 16, her first full poetry collection, Standing Female Nude, did not appear until 1985. She has since written five other collections that include poems about love, women, memory, desire and loss. She often writes dramatic monologues (poems from the point of view of a character) using the voice of an outsider or someone who is often ignored by others. She has been awarded both the OBE and the CBE.\nShe now lives in Manchester, where she teaches creative writing at the Metropolitan University and lives with her daughter, Ella (born in 1995).\nListen to the poem and watch the slideshow\nNobody hurt you. Nobody turned off the light and argued\nwith somebody else all night. The bad man on the moors\nwas only a movie you saw. Nobody locked the door.\nYour questions were answered fully. No. That didn\'t occur.\nYou couldn\'t sing anyway, cared less. The moment\'s a blur, a Film Fun\nlaughing itself to death in the coal fire. Anyone\'s guess.\nNobody forced you. You wanted to go that day. Begged. You chose\nthe dress. Here are the pictures, look at you. Look at us all,\nsmiling and waving, younger. The whole thing is inside your head.\nWhat you recall are impressions; we have the facts. We called the tune.\nThe secret police of your childhood were older and wiser than you, bigger\nthan you. Call back the sound of their voices. Boom. Boom. Boom.\nNobody sent you away. That was an extra holiday, with people\nyou seemed to like. They were firm, there was nothing to fear.\nThere was none but yourself to blame if it ended in tears.\nWhat does it matter now? No, no, nobody left the skidmarks of sin\non your soul and laid you wide open for Hell. You were loved.\nAlways. We did what was best. We remember your childhood well.\nAn extended speech performed by one person only\n: an angry parent (or parents) is talking to a grown-up child. The parent denies that the child was ever hurt or mistreated in any way, although it\'s clear that the child remembers things very differently...\nThe speaker sounds very much on the defensive: clearly the grown-up child has complained about something or asked an awkward question. The parent insists that the child was brought up well and was loved, and suggests that if the child thinks otherwise, they must be imagining it -\n"The whole thing is inside your head"\nLines of poetry that make up a unit; verses.\nof three lines, each of roughly the same length.\nThink about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:\nThink about the title. We may often hear adults saying \'I remember my childhood well\', so it is significant that Duffy has deliberately twisted this to \'We Remember Your Childhood Well\'. The grown-ups definitely present themselves as in control.\nThe poem is written mainly in the past\nThe verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.\nhowever, reminding us that it is dealing with memories. As readers, we cannot be sure whose memory is more accurate - the parents\' or the child\'s. Is the child exaggerating about the horrors that appear to have taken place? Or are the parents guiltily trying to convince themselves that they didn\'t happen?\nWe don\'t know if it is a mother or a father talking. The pronoun \'We\' is used frequently, so whoever is speaking seems to be conveying the thoughts of them both. They could even be talking together (try reading the poem imagining that the mother and father speak alternate stanzas). We also don\'t know whether they are speaking to a son or a daughter: there is nothing to indicate the gender. Perhaps the vagueness is deliberate, to suggest that any parent/child relationship may end up with such tensions like this at some point.\nWe never hear the voice of the person being spoken to, the \'You\' of the poem. We only know their viewpoint through what the parent says. Imagine the reaction of the grown-up child to such vehement denials. How do you think they would feel?\nA group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.\nbegins with a statement that denies what the child believes to have happened - \'Nobody hurt you\' (line 1), \'Nobody sent you away\' (line 13), as if trying to crush the child\'s view of events. There is an apparent contrast between the parent\'s view and the child\'s. \'Nobody forced you. You wanted to go\' (line 7) suggests the parents saw things in one way while the child saw things completely differently. However, sometimes the parent seems to change tack mid-stream, \'You couldn\'t sing anyway, cared less\' (line 5), which could hint that their position is less clear than the child\'s.\nA feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.\nbetween the speaker and listener. We get the impression that the listener is not given much chance to speak - or, if they do, that it is ignored. The parents\' repeated denials are so dominant that the child doesn\'t get a word in edgeways.\nTo some extent, the poem raises more questions than it answers. It is\nA text written by a person of unknown name or identity.\nand so we know little about the speaker (or speakers) or the child they are addressing. The events being denied are left deliberately vague. We wonder what \'didn\'t occur\' (line 4); where did the family \'go that day\' (line 7)? The lack of detail both pulls us into the poem - we really want to know what happened! - and shuts us out. Since the parent doesn\'t need to spell out what they are talking about to their child, the closeness of the family - and the fact that we are outsiders - is emphasised.\nThe parent-child relationship has obviously broken down. Whichever version of events is right, any love and trust between the parents and child has been destroyed. Have the parents \'won\'? The last sentence, a repeat of the title, \'We remember your childhood well\', is their final, decisive word.\nThere are many frightening ideas in the poem that are suggested but not developed:\n(line 2), a door being locked (line 3), the child being\n(line 13). It is left to us to imagine exactly what happened on those occasions, but there is a definite sense of fear on the part of the child. Again, we wonder exactly what took place - who do we believe?\nThere are a number of violent verbs - \'hurt, argued, forced, begged\' - which add to the sense of danger.\n(line 11) brings in an even darker\nA central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.\n, once more creating questions for the reader. Who are these secret police, described as\n- the parents themselves, assuming a role of authority and power, or some other dictatorial group?\nWords that express the sound they stand for, eg \'crunch\', \'pop\'.\n(line 12), which would have drowned out any attempt by the child to put their own point of view. We associate a booming sound with explosions and bombs, so did the voices have the same sort of effect on the child as a bomb attack would have done? It is ironic that the parent uses the\nA description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using \'as\' or \'like\'. \'Sea of troubles\', and \'drowning in debt\' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.\n(line 10) to indicate the control they had over the child, when the \'music\' produced was so violent.\nA group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.\n(line 16) are and what is meant by\n(line 17). What hellish situation is the grown-up child now in? There is a sense of bitterness. It is clear that in the child\'s view at least their current awful situation is the result of what happened in their childhood.\nWhere a phrase or word is repeated several times to emphasise or make a particular point.\nin the poem. Nobody and No are heard constantly, so the negative ideas are hammered home.\nThe pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry.\ncreated by the short sentences within the lines. This gives a feeling of awkwardness, perhaps mirroring the relationship between the parents and child. Nothing is smooth or easy.\nIn poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg \'flow\' and \'bow\' - to form a pattern of sound.\n, but not regular. Sometimes rhymes occur at the ends of lines (moors / door and tune / Boom), sometimes there is internal rhyme (Hell / well). This creates an uneven echo, adding to the\nA feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.\nMuch of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the\nit expresses toward its subject matter. \'Attitude\' can be thought of as a combination of the poet\'s\nhe or she is trying to get across to the reader.\nA good way to decide on the\nThe mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author\'s \'tone of voice\' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.\nof a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud.\nin a harsh, firm way - the parents not only treated the child badly, but now deny that they did, which emphasises their coldness and lack of feeling.\nin a guilty way - the parents realise that they did not really do what was best (line 18) and are now sorry for it.\nwith genuine urgency, as if the parents love the child still and desperately want to be believed. Perhaps the child really did have an over-active imagination and has fabricated everything ...\nWell, there are certainly elements of both harshness and guilt in the tone of this poem. But genuine love? Perhaps it would be\nto read it this way, but for most readers there is too much evidence of the parents\' guilt to make this interpretation convincing!\nThe central idea in this poem is the extent to which people can deceive themselves about how they have behaved. This is shown by the yawning gap between\nwhat the reader can hear being said\nbetween the lines. The parents present themselves as blameless: but as the poem progresses it becomes clearer and clearer to the reader that this is far from the case.\nHere are some examples of this discrepancy between what the parents\ntheir words to mean, and what they\nWhat you recall are impressions; we have the facts.\nYour childhood memories are not accurate; we remember things as they really were.\nThe parents are discounting the child\'s view of events - even though it was the child who actually experienced these things - and arrogantly assume that adults always \'know better\'.\nThat was an extra holiday, with people you seemed to like.\nThe child was positively lucky to get an extra holiday, and with nice people too!\nThe parents were eager to send their child away, and not too fussy about whether the child really did like these people.\nThere was none but yourself to blame if it ended in tears.\nThe child was on holiday in the care of nice people, so it must be the child\'s fault if they didn\'t enjoy themselves.\nSomething obviously went badly wrong on this holiday.

To which poems would you compare\n? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!\nWhat to look for in your comparison\nBoth poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but \'We Remember\' is from the older generation\'s point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.\nRobin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.\nA feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.\nbetween generations, both from the point of view of the older generation.\nThe young people in the Yeats poem seem to have a pleasant time of it; the child in We Remember seems very unhappy.\nBoth poems about the distance between parent and child, both from the point of view of the older generation.\nMargaret\'s love for her child is clearly genuine - the parents \'love\' in the Duffy poem rings hollow.\nIn the exam you\'ll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.\nWhen you are asked to compare poems, it\'s a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:\nsubject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone\nCompare We Remember Your Childhood Well with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that focus on the relationship between two generations.\nThree poems suitable for this comparison would be Simon Armitage\'s Kid, W B Yeats\'s Song of the Old Mother, and William Wordsworth\'s The Affliction of Margaret.\nWhat would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing We Remember Your Childhood Well with each of these three poems.\nIn answering this question you might comment on:\nNow have a go at answer the question, just as you would do in the exam.\nto look at some sample answers to this question...\nWe Remember Your Childhood Well: Test (answer hints)\nBoth poems look at the influence of those in a position of power over young people\n... but in Kid, the child breaks free, whereas in We Remember the parents still seem to have a hold.\nKid is from the point of view of the younger character, whereas We Remember is the voice of the older.\nKid contains humour, yet We Remember is more threatening.\nYeats: The Song of the Old Mother\nBoth poems see tension between two generations.\nBoth are from the point of view of the older generation.\nIn neither poem are the young able to put their own point of view\n... but it does seem that the young people in Yeats\'s poem are satisfied with life - in contrast to the child in Duffy\'s.\nBoth poems are from the point of view of the older generation.\n... and both seem subtly to complain about the younger generation. Margaret complains that she has not heard from her son, while in We Remember, the speaker seems on the defensive with the insistent Nobody...\nMargaret\'s love of her son appears true and genuine (she states I have no other earthly friend), while the speaker in Duffy\'s poem leaves this ambiguous - You were loved.\nBoth poems are about the distance between parents and a child, yet in Margaret\'s case it is an enforced separation, whereas in We Remember we feel that the separation is the fault of the parents.\nOf course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.\n', 'label': '5'}

The lines are pentameters (they have 10 syllables each).\nThink about how the language the poet uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:\nThink about the title. It does not tell us anything about Batman and Robin - it's only when we begin to read the poem that the identity of the 'kid' becomes clear. However, if we go back to the title having read the poem, it may remind us of other young people who are caught up in the shadow (line 20) of someone they admire, and their need to forge their own identity.\nBatman is at first presented as a real superhero: he is described at the start in the alliterative phrase Batman, big shot, as someone who gives orders to Robin. Yet as we read on, his status is diminished. We hear that he\n(line 4) Robin and had an affair with a married woman (line 10). We see him at the end all alone, cooking an unappealing meal for himself (\n(line 21), with next to nothing (line 22) in the house to eat. Can it be that he cannot manage by himself, without Robin around? He is shown as anxious to get going,\n(line 23) with boredom, but unable to do anything.\nThis poem contains various examples of slang, for example naval slang -\n(line 2), British slang - the ordinary word motor (line 11) for the amazing Batmobile, and American slang -\n(line 24). The mixture of styles adds humour and perhaps helps to illustrate the growing-up process: Robin is trying out a mixture of things.\nThere is a serious message behind the comedy - we are encouraged to consider whether heroes and hero-worship can really sustain young people growing up.

{'text': "There are four main stages in setting up a new computer system: Analysis - studying the problem; design - designing a solution; implementation - putting the solution into effect and testing it; evaluation - checking that the solution is working as intended. This process is often called systems analysis.\nDeveloping and activating a new computer system is a long process. It is important to break the process down into smaller stages, each one requiring a different set of professional skills.\nAn important part of this process is the first stage -\n. During this stage the systems analyst will investigate how the current system works and what needs to be improved. This involves finding out whether a new computer system is needed at all and exactly what it will be used for.\nAnalysis is all about looking at how a job is done at present and seeing if the job could be done better or more efficiently by upgrading or developing a new system.\nWith this goal in mind, the systems analyst might:\na step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots\nand any printouts the current system creates\nHaving investigated the present system, the systems analyst will produce a\n. This will look at whether the new system is:\n- is the new system technically possible to implement in the time available?\n- will the cost of the new system be offset by savings once it is implemented, ie will it save the organisation time, money or increase its performance?\nThe project will only continue to the next stage if the answer to both of these questions is yes. At this point the decision makers in the organisation, eg the board of directors, decide whether or not to go ahead.\nThe next step is to draw up a\nthat outlines exactly what the new system will do. For example, it will mention:\na general term used to describe an application or a program\nthe term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process\nthe term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process\nA test plan will be included in the design phase to explain exactly how the new system will be tested and the expected outcomes for each test.\na general term used to describe an application or a program\nis usually very complex. Any mistakes made by the designers or programmer can have a dramatic effect depending on what the software is used for.\nUsually software is tested with three distinct types of\ninformation without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information\n– this is normal data the system should be working with.\n– this is data at the boundary between typical data and invalid data.\nInvalid data (sometimes known as erroneous data)\n– this is data that should cause the system to tell the user that there is a problem with data entered into the system.\nTesting helps to ensure that the system always acts as expected.\nImplementation is the next stage of developing a new system, after design. This is where the new system is created and installed.\na list of instructions written in a programming language\na general term used to describe an application or a program\na resource - for example, a collection of documents containing all the information a user needs to know about using and getting support with a piece of software\ntesting the system using the test plan\nIf the tests are not satisfactory then any problems will need to be corrected and the system tested again.\nUser documentation will be written to help staff become familiar with the new system. It will include:\na step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots\nthe term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process\nthe term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process\ntaking a screen shot of what's displayed on screen and saving it in an image file, eg as a *.jpg, *.bmp or *.gif\ndetails of what error messages mean, ie troubleshooting advice\nWhen the system is ready to go on-line there are different ways of moving from the old to the new system:\nRunning both the old and new system until you are certain the new system is working correctly. Parallel running is likely to be the most expensive as it involves doing the work twice for a period of time. However, it is the safest. If there are any bugs in the new system, you can always go back to the old system while the problems are corrected.\nChanging over in a small part of the company to start with. Only when the system is deemed satisfactory will it be rolled out to the rest of the organisation. A supermarket introducing a new 'self-scanning' system might choose to introduce it in two or three stores at first. This is a pilot changeover.\nThe old system is scrapped and immediately replaced by the new system. With this option there is a danger that there may still be problems with the new system. Even though it is the most risky type of changeover, many companies use this method.\nThe change over is split into phases or stages. Each stage is introduced one at a time and the old system is kept running to do the remainder of the tasks that have not yet been changed.\nOnce the system has been installed it will be monitored to check whether it is working correctly. Sometimes problems with a system will not be found until it is being used by a large number of people or an unusual situation occurs.\nEvaluation is really re-analysing - starting the same systems analysis process all over again. Many of the same techniques can be used, such as interviewing staff or sending out questionnaires.\nOnce a system is running correctly it can still need maintenance. This may be because a bug is found or because the company needs a new feature.\n", 'label': '5'}

The 'greyness' (line 1) is heightened by the heavy alliteration 'in drizzle of one despondent dawn' (line 2) and even the approaching 'sunbreak' (line 4) does not lift the atmosphere.\nThere are metaphors of horror and death: the 'dead tree' (line 6) branch on which the vultures are roosting is described as a 'broken bone' (line 5), while the male vulture's bashed-in head is a 'pebble on a stem' (line 9) and its body is a 'dump of gross feathers' (line 11).\nIn the second section, the vultures' affection leads the poet on to muse about the nature of love. Love is personified as a woman finding a place to sleep. She is 'in other ways so particular' (line 23) and hard to please, yet, strangely, she chooses to sleep with the vultures, 'that charnel house' (line 26). Yet why does love sleep with 'her face turned to the wall' (line 28)?\nWe see the 'Belsen Commandant' - a mass murderer - as Daddy. Why does Achebe use a child's name for him rather than 'father'?\nIn the fourth section, the poet again uses metaphors: the evil Commandant is 'an ogre' (line 43) with merely a spark of love - 'a tiny glow-worm tenderness' (line 44) in the 'icy caverns of a cruel heart' (line 46). These are fairly clichÃ©d images, perhaps because Achebe wanted to suggest that what he is describing is nothing new: there will always be love and evil in the world.\nThe 'germ' (line 48) of love does not seem to grow as a normal seed would because the 'perpetuity of evil' (line 50) is bound up with it and prevents it from developing.

{'text': "Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who studied variation in plants and animals during a five-year voyage around the world in the 19th century.

However, even Emilia, who has picked up the handkerchief, has no idea he is using it for this reason. We also know that the conversation between Cassio and Iago about a woman is designed to enrage Othello, but Cassio has no idea about this. And even when Desdemona goes to speak to Othello towards the end of the play, we know he intends to kill her, but she is unaware. Dramatic irony is often used to make the audience more involved - we know what is happening but feel powerless to do anything (and that is why we are the audience, not the actors).\nThe key to understanding dramatic effect is to think about the feelings being created in the audience. It's not about reading the play but experiencing it. And the feelings we have are not accidental, but created by putting certain events together, or by explaining a character's thoughts and motivations, or by suggesting what will happen next.

It is labour-intensive, because every product is different. One-off graphic products might include a presentation book as a souvenir of a special event, or a model of a theatre set.\nis when a set quantity of the product is made. It may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product. Batch-produced graphic products include programmes for a play or concert, or posters to advertise a play or concert.\nis when a very large number of the product is made, usually on a production line - but the process cannot be continuous because the product regularly changes. Examples of mass-produced graphic products are newspapers and magazines.\nproduction is when many thousands of products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to eliminate the expense of stopping and restarting the production process. The process is often automated and few workers are required. Continuous-flow production is used for graphics products which sell very large numbers throughout the year, and do not need to be frequently changed - such as cereal packaging.\nInformation and communications technology is widely used in manufacturing graphics products. Its benefits are that:\nit makes it easy to produce accurate, complex, standardised drawings\nIt allows complex shapes to be made with ease and precision\nit enables changes to be made quickly and easily, and\nit greatly simplifies batch or mass production\nCAM machines are good for batch or mass production, and they are also useful for one-off products that are complicated to make. There are two types of CAM machine:\nPlotter/cutters can be used either for cutting of card and vinyl, or (by replacing the blade with a pen) to produce drawings and lettering prior to cutting. Cutter/printers are more complex CAM machines which allow full-colour printing before cutting is done.\nThese are mainly used for cutting plastics, hard wax, soft metals and wood-based materials such as MDF. They are particularly useful for making prototype models and moulds for vacuum-forming. Some of these machines can have a scanner head fitted in place of the cutting tool, allowing 3D scanning to be done.\n', 'label': '5'}

The total momentum in an explosion or collision stays the same.\nYou should know, and be able to use, the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved.\nWork and energy are measured in the same unit, the joule (J). When an object is moved by a force, energy is transferred and work is done. But work is not a form of energy - it is one of the ways in which energy can be transferred.\nThis equation shows the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved:\nwork done (joule, J) = force (newton, N) × distance (metre, m)\nThe distance involved is the distance moved in the direction of the applied force.\nA force of 10N is applied to a box to move it 2m along the floor.

For example, if you lift a book up onto a shelf, you have to do work against the force of gravity. The book has gained gravitational potential energy.\nElastic objects such as elastic bands and squash balls can change their shape. They can be stretched or squashed, but energy is needed to change their shape. This energy is stored in the stretched or squashed object as\n(sometimes called movement energy). The more mass an object has, and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. You should be able to discuss the transformation of kinetic energy to other forms of energy.\nSeveral energy transfers happen when a squash ball is dropped onto a table and bounces up again.\nWhen the ball is stationary above the table, its gravitational potential energy (GPE) is at a maximum. It has no kinetic energy (KE), or elastic potential energy (EPE).\nAs the ball falls, its GPE is transferred to KE and the ball accelerates towards the table.\nWhen the ball hits the table, the KE is transferred to EPE as the ball squashes. As the ball regains its shape, the EPE is transferred to KE and it bounces upwards.\nWhen the ball reaches the top of its travel, all the KE has been transferred to GPE again. Note that the ball will be lower than it was when it was first dropped, because some energy is also transferred as heat and sound to the surroundings.\nThe pendulum is a simple machine for transferring gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy, and back again.\nWhen the bob is at the highest point of its swing, it has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum. As the bob swings downwards, gravitational potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy, and the bob accelerates.\nAt the bottom of its swing, the bob’s kinetic energy is at a maximum and its gravitational potential energy is at a minimum.\nAs the bob swings upwards, its kinetic energy is transferred to gravitational potential energy again. At the top of its swing, it once again has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum.\nNote that the bob’s swing will become lower with each swing, because some energy is also transferred as heat to the surroundings.\nHere is a version of the 'Work and Energy' podcast with drawings to help explain things.\nIn order to see this content you need to have both\n. This is the tendency of the object to keep moving in the same direction. It is difficult to change the direction of movement of an object with a lot of momentum.\nYou can calculate momentum using this equation:\nmomentum (kg m/s) = mass (kg) × velocity (m/s)\nmagnitude - an amount because it depends on the object’s mass\ndirection - because it depends on the velocity of the object\nWhat is the momentum of a 5 kg object moving at 2 m/s?\nSo long as no external forces are acting on the objects involved, the total momentum stays the same in explosions and collisions. We say that momentum is conserved. You can use this idea to work out the mass, velocity or momentum of an object in an explosion or collision.\nA bullet with a mass of 0.03 kg leaves a gun at 1000 m/s. If the gun’s mass is 1.5 kg, what is the velocity of the recoil on the gun?\nmomentum of bullet = mass × velocity\nRearrange the equation: velocity = momentum ÷ mass\nvelocity of recoil on gun = 30 kg m/s ÷ 1.5 kg\nWhen there is a car crash, the car, its contents, and the passengers, decelerate rapidly. They experience great forces because of the change in momentum, which can cause injury. If the time taken for the change in momentum on the body is increased, the forces on the body are reduced too. Seat belts and crumple zones are designed to reduce the forces on the body if there is a collision.\nSeat belts stop you tumbling around inside the car if there is a collision. However, they are designed to stretch a bit in a collision. This increases the time taken for the body’s momentum to reach zero, so reduces the forces on it.\nAir bags increase the time taken for the head’s momentum to reach zero, so reduce the forces on it. They also act a soft cushion and prevent cuts.\nCrumple zones are another safety feature in cars\nYou should know, and be able to use, the relationship between kinetic energy, mass and speed.\nThis equation shows the relationship between kinetic energy (J), mass (kg) and speed (m/s):\nWhat is the kinetic energy of a 1,000kg car travelling at 10m/s?\n× 1,000 × 100 = 50,000J (or 50kJ)\nCheck your understanding of this section by having a go at the activity.\nYour web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

What force is needed to bring it to a halt in 5 s?\nMomentum at start = 25 × 12 = 300 kg m/s\nMomentum at end = 0 × 12 = 0 kg m/s\nChange in momentum = 300 - 0 kg m/s\nSo a force of 60N is needed.\nYou should see that, for a given change in momentum, the longer the time taken, the smaller the force needed. This is the idea behind many car safety features.

So what should you do if you are going to do as well as possible in an examination? Here are some tips:\nMake sure that you arrive in good time for the examination. Get everything that you need ready in advance. There's nothing worse than having to rush.\nCheck the starting time and how long the exam will last. Do not get taken by surprise. You can get this information from your teacher at school.\nMake sure you know how many questions you have to answer and how long you can afford to spend on each.\nMake sure that your watch is working. Put it on your desk where you can see it, rather than wearing it on your wrist where you will have to stop and look at it.\nAlways have at least two pens and make sure that they are working. They must be blue or black - but check this with your teacher first.\nIf you like to draw diagrams, have a pencil handy and sharpen it.\nMake sure that you have everything else that you need. A picture of your pet or something that makes you laugh will help you feel positive in your exam.\nMake sure that you understand where you have a choice of questions.

Rounding and estimating are two ways to make numbers easier to manage.\nGiving the complete number for something is sometimes unnecessary. For instance, the attendance at a football match might be\n. But for most people who want to know the attendance figure, an answer of '\nWe can round off large numbers like these to the nearest thousand, nearest hundred, nearest ten, nearest whole number, or any other specified number.\nFirst, look at the digit in the thousands place. It is 3. This means the number lies between 23000 and 24000. Look at the digit to the right of the 3. It is 7. That means 23745 is closer to\nThe rule is, if the next digit is:\nWhat is 23745 rounded to the nearest ten?\nIf so, well done! You saw that 23745 lies between 23740 and 23750, but is closer to 23750.\nIf you did not get the correct answer, remember that the tens digit is 4. This means that the number lies between 23740 and 23750. The next digit is 5, so we round up: 23745 = 23750 to the nearest ten.\nSometimes, rather than rounding off to the nearest whole number, you might need to be a little more accurate. You might need to include some of the digits after the decimal point.\nIn these cases, we can round off the number up to a certain number of decimal places.\nDo not confuse this with rounding off using significant figures (intermediate), as this is slightly different!\nThe same rules for rounding up apply here:\nWrite 2.6470588 to 2 decimal places (dp).\n? You needed to round up. We want 2 decimal places.\ndecimal digit is 4. So the number lies between 2.64 and 2.65\nThe next digit is 7, so we have to round up. So the answer is\n, giving your answer correct to one decimal place.\nWe need one decimal place. That means one number after the decimal point. The 1\nnumber after the decimal point is 8.\nThis means the answer lies between 7.8 and 7.9\nThe next digit is 7. This means we have to round up.\nRound off the number 3.9762645 to 1 dp.\nThe number lies between 3.9 and 4.0. The 7 after the 9 means you have to round up. So the answer is\nSometimes we do not always need to give detailed answers to problems - we just want a rough idea. When we are faced with a long number, we could round it off to the nearest thousand, or nearest million. And when we get a long decimal answer on a calculator, we could round it off to a certain number of decimal places.\nAnother method of giving an approximated answer is to round off using\nmeans important. The closer a digit is to the beginning of a number, the more important - or significant - it is.\nis the most significant digit, because it tells us that the number is\nand something. It follows that the 6 is the next most significant, and so on.\nis the most significant digit, because it tells us that the number is\n. The 8 is the next most significant, and so on.\nWe round off a number using a certain number of significant figures. The most common are 1, 2 or 3 significant figures.\nRemember the rules for rounding up are the same as before:\nWhat would you get if you wrote the number 368249 correct to 1 significant figure?\n3 is the first significant figure, and the digit after it is a 5, so you round up.\nWhat would you get if you wrote the number 0.00245 correct to 1 significant figure?\n2 is the first significant figure and the digit after this is less than 5, so you do not round up.\nWhat would you get if you wrote 0.0000058763 correct to 2 significant figures?\nYou had to round up the 8 to 9.\nIf you had problems, remember that the 2 most significant figures are 5 and 8. The digit after 8 is 7, so we have to round up 8 to 9.\nWe can use significant figures to get an approximate answer to a problem.\nWe can round off all the numbers in a maths problem to 1 significant figure to make 'easier' numbers. It is often possible to do this in your head.\nWe first round off both numbers to 1 significant figure (s.f.):\nSo we now need to make the denominator a whole number.

The railway line linked the towns of London and Bristol and was often referred to as "God\'s Wonderful Railway" because the route was so smooth and it was a perfect example of railway engineering.\nThe line was so successful that it was later extended to connect to Plymouth and Cornwall. Brunel used his considerable skills on the route and\nbuilt the Tamar Bridge and Box Tunnel\nOne of the reasons why Brunel\'s railway routes and tracks were so smooth is because, unlike George Stephenson,\nhe used a gauge of 7 feet 3 inches\n. He believed that this gauge was not only the safest, but would allow trains to travel faster and give the passengers more comfort. Unfortunately, 92 per cent of the railway tracks in Britain had already been built at Stephenson\'s gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches. This led to\nthe Gauge Act being passed in 1846\n, which stated that all train tracks had to be built to George Stephenson\'s gauge width. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had\n.

{'text': "Electric motors transfer electrical energy into kinetic energy, using magnets and coils of wire. There is a relationship between electrical power, voltage and current (power = voltage × current).\nWhenever useful energy is transferred, some energy that is not useful is also transferred – we say such energy is 'wasted'. When you measure the efficiency of a device, you measure how much of the energy supplied is useful.\nThe cost of electricity depends upon the amount of electrical power used, the amount of time it is used for, and the charge made for each unit of electricity. It is possible to reduce heat losses from homes using insulation, and this saves money, but some methods of insulation are more cost-effective than others.\nIf you are given information such as a diagram, you should be able to explain how an electric motor works.\nA simple electric motor can be built using a coil of wire that is free to rotate between two opposite magnetic poles. When an electric current flows through the coil, the coil experiences a force and moves.\nThe direction of the current must be reversed every half turn, otherwise the coil comes to a halt again. This is achieved using a conducting ring split in two, called a\n.

This Revision Bite will look at his contribution to the railway network.\nThe development of railways during the 19th century happened because of the work of three main engineers. We have already mentioned Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson, but Isambard Kingdom Brunel also played a key role.\nwho designed steam trains, oversaw the construction of new railway tracks and built some amazing and breathtaking bridges and tunnels along his railway routes.\nthe chief engineer of the Great Western Railway\n(GWR) in 1833. The railway line linked the towns of London and Bristol and was often referred to as "God\'s Wonderful Railway" because the route was so smooth and it was a perfect example of railway engineering.\nThe line was so successful that it was later extended to connect to Plymouth and Cornwall. Brunel used his considerable skills on the route and\nbuilt the Tamar Bridge and Box Tunnel\nOne of the reasons why Brunel\'s railway routes and tracks were so smooth is because, unlike George Stephenson,\nhe used a gauge of 7 feet 3 inches\n. He believed that this gauge was not only the safest, but would allow trains to travel faster and give the passengers more comfort. Unfortunately, 92 per cent of the railway tracks in Britain had already been built at Stephenson\'s gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches. This led to\nthe Gauge Act being passed in 1846\n, which stated that all train tracks had to be built to George Stephenson\'s gauge width. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had\n.

{'text': 'The characters we see as the curtain rises are not the same as those at the plays conclusion. The events of the evening change everyone, as well as their expectations of the future. Inspector Goole is instrumental in disturbing the harmony; a purposeful, mysterious character who forces the characters to confront each other\'s social responsibility, snobbery and guilt. But is the inspector as genuine as he seems?\nAll these changes take place because of the visit of Inspector Goole. But who is Inspector Goole? And who is the girl whose suicide he is apparently investigating?\nHe is described at the start as a\n"heavy-looking, rather portentous man in his middle fifties but rather provincial in his speech."\nHe has worked his way up in the world and is\nof his achievements. He boasts about having been Mayor and tries (and fails) to impress the Inspector with his local standing and his influential friends.\nHowever, he is aware of people who are his social superiors, which is why he shows off about the port to Gerald,\n"it\'s exactly the same port your father gets."\nHe is proud that he is likely to be knighted, as that would move him even higher in social circles.\n"is one of the happiest nights of my life."\nThis is not only because Sheila will be happy, but because a merger with Crofts Limited will be good for his business.\nfor the future and confident that there will not be a war. As the audience knows there\nbe a war, we begin to doubt Mr Birling\'s judgement. (If he is wrong about the war, what else will he be wrong about?)\nHe wants to protect himself and his family. He believes that socialist ideas that stress the importance of the community are\n"a man has to make his own way."\nHe wants to protect Birling and Co. He cannot see that he did anything wrong when he fired Eva Smith - he was just looking after his business interests.\nHe wants to protect his reputation. As the Inspector\'s investigations continue, his selfishness gets the better of him: he is worried about how the press will view the story in Act II, and accuses Sheila of disloyalty at the start of Act III. He wants to hide the fact that Eric stole money:\n"I\'ve got to cover this up as soon as I can."\nAt the end of the play, he knows he has lost the chance of his knighthood, his reputation in Brumley and the chance of Birling and Co. merging with their rivals. Yet he hasn\'t learnt the lesson of the play: he is unable to admit his responsibility for his part in Eva\'s death.\nShe is described at the start as\n"about fifty, a rather cold woman and her husband\'s social superior."\n, very aware of the differences between social classes. She is irritated when Mr Birling makes the social gaffe of praising the cook in front of Gerald and later is very dismissive of Eva, saying\nShe has the least respect for the Inspector of all the characters. She tries - unsuccessfully - to intimidate him and force him to leave, then lies to him when she claims that she does not recognise the photograph that he shows her.\nShe sees Sheila and Eric still as\nthat she doesn\'t want to believe: Eric\'s drinking, Gerald\'s affair with Eva, and the fact that a working class girl would refuse money even if it was stolen, claiming\nagainst the girl who applied to her committee for help and saw it as her\nto refuse to help her. Her narrow sense of morality dictates that the father of a child should be responsible for its welfare, regardless of circumstances.\nAt the end of the play, she has had to come to terms that her son is a heavy drinker who got a girl pregnant and stole money to support her, her daughter will not marry a good social \'catch\' and that her own reputation within the town will be sullied. Yet, like her husband, she refuses to believe that she did anything wrong and doesn\'t accept responsibility for her part in Eva\'s death.\nShe is described at the start as\n"a pretty girl in her early twenties, very pleased with life and rather excited."\nEven though she seems very playful at the opening, we know that she has had suspicions about Gerald when she mentions\n"last summer, when you never came near me."\nDoes this suggest that she is not as naive and shallow as she first appears?\nAlthough she has probably never in her life before considered the conditions of the workers, she shows her\nimmediately she hears of her father\'s treatment of Eva Smith:\n"But these girls aren\'t cheap labour - they\'re people."\nShe is horrified by her own part in Eva\'s story. She feels full of\nfor her jealous actions and blames herself as\n: she realises that Gerald knew Daisy Renton from his reaction, the moment the Inspector mentioned her name. At the end of Act II, she is the first to realise Eric\'s part in the story. Significantly, she is the first to wonder who the Inspector really is, saying to him, \'wonderingly\',\n"he\'s giving us the rope - so that we\'ll hang ourselves"\n(Act II) and, near the end, is the first to consider whether the Inspector may not be real.\nShe genuinely wants to know about Gerald\'s part in the story. It\'s interesting that she is not angry with him when she hears about the affair: she says that she respects his honesty. She is becoming\nwith her parents in Act 3 for trying to\n"It frightens me the way you talk:"\nshe cannot understand how they cannot have learnt from the evening in the same way that she has. She is seeing her parents in a new, unfavourable light.\nAt the end of the play, Sheila is much\nShe can now judge her parents and Gerald from a new perspective, but the greatest change has been in herself: her social conscience has been awakened and she is aware of her responsibilities. The Sheila who had a girl dismissed from her job for a trivial reason has vanished forever.\nHe is described at the start as\n"in his early twenties, not quite at ease, half shy, half assertive."\nright from the start. The fist mention of him in the script is\nand then he is unable to explain his laughter, as if he is nervous about something. (It is not until the final act that we realise this must be because of his having stolen some money.) There is another awkward moment when Gerald, Birling and Eric are chatting about women\'s love of clothes before the Inspector arrives. Do you feel that there is tension in Eric\'s relationship with his father?\nIt soon becomes clear to us (although it takes his parents longer) that he is a\n"I have gathered that he does drink pretty hard."\nWhen he hears how his father sacked Eva Smith, he supports the worker\'s cause, like Sheila.\n"Why shouldn\'t they try for higher wages?"\nwith himself over his relationship with the girl. He cries,\n"Oh - my God! - how stupid it all is!"\nas he tells his story. He is horrified that his thoughtless actions had such consequences.\n, though, because although he got a woman pregnant, he was concerned enough to give her money. He was obviously less worried about stealing (or \'borrowing\' from his father\'s office) than he was about the girl\'s future. So, was Eric, initially, the most socially aware member of the Birling family?\nHe is appalled by his parents\' inability to admit their own responsibility. He tells them forcefully,\nWhen Birling tries to threaten him in Act III, Eric is aggressive in return:\nDo you think Eric has ever stood up to his father in this way before?\nAt the end of the play, like Sheila, he is fully aware of his social responsibility. He is not interested in his parents\' efforts to cover everything up: as far as he is concerned, the important thing is that a girl is dead.\n"an attractive chap about thirty, rather too manly to be a dandy but very much the easy well-bred man-about-town."\n- the son of Lord and Lady Croft. We realise that they are not over-impressed by Gerald\'s engagement to Sheila because they declined the invitation to the dinner.\nHe is not as willing as Sheila to admit his part in the girl\'s death to the Inspector and initially pretends that he never knew her. Is he a bit like Mr Birling, wanting to protect his own interests?\nHe did have some genuine feeling for Daisy Renton, however: he is very moved when he hears of her death. He tells Inspector Goole that he arranged for her to live in his friend\'s flat\n"She was young and pretty and warm-hearted - and intensely grateful."\nDespite this, in Act 3 he tries to come up with as much evidence as possible to prove that the Inspector is a fake - because that would get him off the hook. It is Gerald who confirms that the local force has no officer by the name of Goole, he who realises it may not have been the same girl and he who finds out from the infirmary that there has not been a suicide case in months. He seems to throw his energies into\nAt the end of the play, he has not changed. He has not gained a new sense of social responsibility, which is why Sheila (who has) is unsure whether to take back the engagement ring.\nHe is described on his entrance as creating\n"an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness. He is a man in his fifties, dressed in a plain darkish suit. He speaks carefully, weightily, and has a disconcerting habit of looking hard at the person he addresses before actually speaking. "\n"one person and one line of enquiry at a time."\nHis method is to confront a suspect with a piece of information and then make them talk - or, as Sheila puts it,\n"he\'s giving us the rope - so that we\'ll hang ourselves."\nHe deals with each member of the family very firmly and several times we see him\n"massively taking charge as disputes erupt between them."\nHe is not impressed when he hears about Mr Birling\'s influential friends and he cuts through Mrs Birling\'s obstructiveness.\nHe knows the history of Eva Smith and the Birlings\' involvement in it, even though she died only hours ago. Sheila tells Gerald,\nHe knows things are going to happen - He says\njust before Eric\'s return, as if he expected Eric to reappear at exactly that moment\nHe is obviously in a great hurry towards the end of the play: he stresses\nDoes he know that the real inspector is shortly going to arrive?\nHis final speech is like a sermon or a politician\'s. He leaves the family with the message\nthat will result if they do not pay attention to what he has taught them.\nsuggests that the Inspector is not a \'real\' person. So, what is he?\nIs he a ghost?

{'text': "Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.\npoint is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.\nThe breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.\nBefore you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:\nRenting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs\nThese do not change as output changes, eg rent.\nare constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.\nWages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs\nThese change according to output eg raw materials.\ninclude raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.\nBy adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the\nFixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.\nThe firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.\nYou need to establish how many units are to be produced.\nYou need to know the selling price of the units.\nOnce you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.\nThese do not change as output changes, eg rent.\nThese change according to output eg raw materials.\nYou may find it helpful to work through the\nHere is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:\nYou first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).\nThen you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:\nvariable cost per unit × number of units\nIn this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is £2 and there are 2 000 units = £4,000\nOnce you have done this, you are ready to plot the\nThe value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.\nsales price × number of units (output)\nIf the sales price is £6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:\n£6.00 × 2,000 = £12,000 total revenue\nWhere the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.\nFixed costs: £10,000, Variable costs: £2 per unit, Sales price: £6 per unit\nIf you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs\nIf you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: £15,000\nAs with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:\nEither way, the result should be the same.\nFor the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.\nIf you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.\nBreakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.\nUse the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:\nYou should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of £14,000.\nIf you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.\n", 'label': '5'}

{'text': 'Coal was one of the vital elements that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. The mining of coal changed from being a small-scalle operation to become a large-scale operation helped by major technological advances.\nThe Industrial Revolution would not have happened without coal.\nIt is sometimes suggested that the key to the increase in coal production was an increase in scale, not a technological revolution. Certainly,\nthe organisation of the industry changed hugely\n, from small-scale adit or bell pits employing about 20 miners, to deep-shaft mines run by wealthy coal magnates such as Lord Londonderry.\nHowever, the reason that coal mining had been restricted to small surface mining was because\nworking deeper mines had encountered technological difficulties\nsuch as flooding, explosions, chokedamp, roof-falls, and lifting and transporting the coal. By the 19th century, these problems had been overcome by technological changes.\nkey to the increase in production was the use of the steam engine\n. The steam engine was powered by coal, so as the steam engine improved and was used in more industries, this led to an increased demand for coal.\nA similar example of industries interacting to cause the Industrial Revolution is between coal and the railways. The first steam trains in the world and the first railway in the world - the Stockton and Darlington Railway 1825 - were built to transport coal to the docks. However,\nrailways proved so popular and grew so big that they became a major user of coal\nin the 19th century, and this increased the demand for coal.\nBack to Industry 1700 - 1900 index\nAll things historic - from ancient to modern.\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

Traditionally it has often been used for epitaphs - ie, reflections on what persists after a person's death.\nThese poems contain extended metaphors - one describing the body in terms of food or a clock, the other describing the couple's relationship in terms of a bed.\nBoth poems are quite intimate: one describes the writer's attitude towards his own body parts, the other Anne Hathaway's memories of love-making with her remarkable husband.\nBoth poems focus on one all-important thing that is seen as persisting, despite death: Armitage's heart, - his 'pendulum, the ticker' - and Anne Hathaway's 'living, laughing love - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head'.\nSonnets have traditionally been used to express intimate, personal feelings and thoughts about big subjects like love and death. They often make heavy use of metaphor.\nBoth these poems talk about death - about what goes and what might live on in some way. Both poems could be seen as a kind of epitaph.\nThe Armitage sonnet uses a series of metaphors of the body as food, or a clock. The Jonson sonnet has two metaphors: that of the debt - 'Seven years tho'wert lent to me, and I thee pay' - and the child as a poem - 'Ben Jonson his best piece of poetrie'.\nThe mood of the two poems is very different: one looking humourously forward to the writer's own death, the other looking back at someone else's death with grief and a kind of resignation.\nSonnets are compact, tightly structured poems. They are ideal for describing a single scene or idea, or capturing a moment of intense feeling.\nThese poems both do just that. Armitage's expresses the kind of wry thought that might strike you while you sit in a hospital waiting room; Whitman's describes a momentary wild thought while walking in a storm\nBoth poems are densely descriptive, with images tumbling confusedly over each other.\nBoth sonnets are fairly free: Whitman's poem has 6 beats/line instead of the usual 5, and a single half-rhyme echoing through the whole poem. Armitage's uses a mixture of 4 or 5 beats/line and rhymes erratically. They also both also seem to tail off at the end with extra short lines.\nOf course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say!

Hunting then pre-occupies him more and more through the novel.\nHe can\'t kill the first pig he sees because of\n"the enormity of the knife descending and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood"\n. Yet he quickly puts aside any doubts.\n"All you can talk about is pig, pig, pig!"\nJack paints on a mask to help him hunt better. The paint gives him a liberation into savagery: he is able to do savage things now he looks more like a savage.\nHe is so moved by having killed a pig that he isn\'t anxious about the ship that went by while the fire was out. All he thinks about is the knowledge that\n"they had outwitted a living thing, imposed their will on it, taken away its life"\nBy the end, Jack has moved on even further. His prey has gone beyond pigs - he is keen to hunt Ralph.\nHe commits the first act of violence towards another boy on the island when he thumps Piggy.\n. He gets gradually more violent towards other boys: he has no thought for Piggy when he steals his glasses and later he ties up and beats Wilfred.\nHe pretends not to be frightened of the beast - but is shivering and croaking when he sees the \'beast\' on the mountain. Does this suggest that he\'s not really as brave as he\'d like to think he is?\n, it\'s soon clear he doesn\'t care about the rules or being civilised:\n" Bollocks to the rules! We\'re strong - we hunt! "\nHe rejects the order that had been established on the island:\n"We don\'t need the conch any more"\nAt the end, he has no remorse for Piggy\'s death. He declares himself Chief. He has lost the name Jack, which suggests he has lost all.\n"a slight, furtive boy whom no one knew, who kept to himself with an inner intensity of avoidance and secrecy."\n"the shock of black hair, down his nape and low on his forehead, seemed to suit his gloomy face and make what had seemed at first unsociable remoteness in to something foreboding."\nWhen he is first seen, he is described as\nHe is a loner and uncommunicative by nature.\nHe is cruel. He deliberately spoils the littluns\' games. Later, he relishes sharpening a stick at both ends with which to kill Ralph.\nHe volunteers to go up the mountain with Ralph and Jack to find the beast.\nHe becomes Jack\'s right hand man: they torture Samneric together to find out Ralph\'s hiding place. Yet he is capable of acting independently: he levers the rock that kills Piggy on his own initiative.\nHe is an executioner. He kills Piggy and, in the final hunt, Ralph fears Roger because he\n"What intelligence had been shown was traceable to Piggy."\n"Piggy was an outsider, not only by accent, which did not matter, but by fat, and ass-mar, and specs, and a certain disinclination to manual labour."\nHe has physical disadvantages because he is fat and asthmatic and is short sighted. Without his glasses, everything becomes a blur.\nHe is very intelligent - in Chapter 1 it is his idea to make a list of names, and it is he who realises that no adult knows the boys are on the island. Later he suggests making a sundial and hats. Ralph recognises Piggy could think:\n"Piggy, for all his ludicrous body, had brains"\nHowever, he does not speak as grammatically accurately as the others:\n" How can you expect to be rescues if you don\'t put first things first and act proper"\n. Perhaps this is to suggest he wasn\'t as well educated as the others and that he is not from the right class of people to be a successful leader. At the time the novel was written most power was still in the hands of the middle and upper classes.\nHe is embarrassed by his nickname, and he behaves with dignity when Ralph betrays the name to the others. We never know his real name.\nHe is kind and considerate to the littluns. He helps the boy with the birthmark talk about the \'snake-thing\' and helps Percival talk about the beast. He is later often left to care for them when the others are exploring and hunting.\nHe has the most mature attitude of any boy on the island. He scornfully sees the other boys\nHe is pragmatic. When Simon dies, Piggy tries to convince Ralph there was nothing they could have done:\n"It was an accident... and that\'s that"\nLike Ralph, he believes in civilised values and clings to what creates order:\n" I just take the conch to say this. I can\'t see no more and I got to get my glasses back"\n. When they go to the fort to confront Jack, he shouts\nto try to show Jack that he has a right to be heard.\nPiggy and the conch are destroyed together by the rock Roger levers. Thus both intelligence and the symbol of authority are dead, so we know that there is nothing left to stop Jack gaining full control.\nAt the end, Ralph mourns the fall through the air of\n"he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course"\n"He walked with an accustomed tread through the fruit trees"\nThe first time we meet Simon, he is in his choir robes. He faints on the beach because of the heat and Jack mocks him. We know he is delicate. He has epilepsy.\n"a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course"\n. His hair hides his face, which hints to us he is secretive.\nHe is imaginative: he sees the buds on the bushes as\nHe is helpful and works for the good of others; he is the only one to stick with Ralph to make the shelters. He is kind to the littluns and finds fruit for them.\nThe others recognise he is \'different\' to them in some way. Ralph says\n"a secret place in a clearing full of flowers and butterflies"\n, and is sufficiently at one with the jungle to walk in it alone at night. He is at one with nature and he has no fear.\nHe seems able to prophesy - he is the first to suggest that\n"You\'ll get back to where you came from"\nHe is the most perceptive about the beast. He says\n"maybe there is a beast... What I mean is... maybe it\'s only us"\n. He is the only one to see that the problems on the island stem from the boys\' relationships with each other, not from an outside force. Yet nobody understands what he\'s trying to say.\nWhen the Lord of the Flies \'speaks\' to him this idea is reiterated: the voice in Simon\'s head says\n"Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!... You knew, didn\'t you? I\'m part of you?"\nHe is killed just as he is about to reveal the truth. It is ironic that he is the only one who finds out that the \'beast\' was a dead parachutist, but is denied passing on the message because the group of boys think, in their frenzy, he is the beast.\nSimon\'s close relationship with nature seems to carry on even after he is dead:\n" The waves turned the corpse gently in the water. ... Softly, surrounded by a fringe of bright inquisitive creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon\'s dead body moved out towards the open sea"\n"They were twins and the eye was shocked and incredulous at such cheery duplication. They breathed together, they grinned together, they were chunky and vital. They raised wet lips at Ralph, for they seemed provided with not quite enough skin, so that their profiles were blurred and their mouths pulled open."\nThe twins gradually lost their individual names on the island and become Samneric. They depend upon each other and do everything together.\nThey are the first to see the parachutist (while they are tending the fire at night) and think it is a beast.\nThey share Ralph and Piggy\'s dismay at the death of Simon.\nThey are involved in the first successful pig hunt with Jack, but more and more they grow to support Ralph. They join the fight against Jack when Jack raids the shelters at night to get Piggy\'s glasses. Finally, only Samneric and Piggy are left on Ralph\'s side. Yet they are not strong enough to withstand a lot of pressure, and ultimately reveal Ralph\'s hiding place to Roger and Jack. In the end evil triumphs over good.\n', 'label': '5'}

She remains fascinated with the creative process and likens the way clay can be transformed to a spirited, colourful and glazed vessel through firing to the growth of a tree from a seed.\nHer passion for ceramics was strengthened at high school, and experimentation with other art mediums strengthened her conviction that pottery was her natural vocation.\nThe work Kate creates ranges in size from intricate palm-sized pieces to exuberant, bold pots large enough for children to sit in. She also creates a variety of work from public fountains to gallery installation pieces.\nKate has become well known for her use of\non her work. The crystalline glazes produce crystal growth on the surface (as seen on \'Queen Pineapple\').\nThe glazes can almost be bad taste as they are so glitzy and clever, like 80s disco wallpaper or jazzy wrapping paper. I myself enjoy kitsch and aim to sometimes offset crystal bad taste with kitsch â€“ thus marrying form and surface. At other times crystals can be gentle and extraordinarily delicate making them a fabulously versatile friend to have in the often difficult glaze department.\nKey influences on Kate\'s work are the\nnatural world, fertility and the magic of growth\n, which she refers to as the "life force". Positive symbolism, fun and humour are also key to her work.\nAlthough most of Kate\'s pieces are based on\n, such as fruit and vegetables, she cites fashion designers\nas inspirations for the way she "dresses up" her pots.\nKate on the creative processes involved in ceramics:\nI prepare my clay very soft. I use T Material which usually arrives pretty hard, so I slice up a bag, make rows of wells in each slice, fill those with water, wait a few days and then wedge.\nI adore coiling. I think it is my favourite part of the whole of making ceramics ... except the anticipation and excitement of opening the kiln door. The slow process of the evolution of a form suits the way I work and think. When I have a concept for a pot I usually start a few pieces, making one of them follow my original idea, the others started are then free to change during the coiling of the form. It is these pieces that are so full of surprises and unsure excitement.\nI roll coils using both hands. I concentrate by closing my eyes and feeling the coil and reacting to it through touch alone. When I meet students who admit to not being able to roll a prefect coil I tell them to do it blindfold and get good reports back. You can not really see anything below your hands so you do really have to rely on touch alone to roll a coil. I adore rolling perfect soft long coils.\nThe artist on the subject of glazes:\nI mix [glaze] very thick. I apply using a variety of brushes. I try to create forms that will work with the fluidity of the glaze, create pools for crystals to grow in, and shoulders and round rims and gulleys and valleys for them to slide off and show their trail of movement.\nI often use three to six different glazes on one surface and blob and layer them together in a series of patches. These overlap in areas and create other effects. I keep a record of the order in which I apply the different recipes as effects change if the order changes.\n', 'label': '5'}

{'text': "Steps can be taken to manage flooding. Often these steps involve trying to lengthen the amount of time it takes for water to reach the river channel, thereby increasing the lag time. Flood management techniques can be divided into\n'Hard' options tend to be more expensive and have a greater impact on the river and the surrounding landscape.\n'Soft' options are more ecologically sensitive. The tables summarise the main flood management techniques.\nDams are often built along the course of a river in order to control the amount of discharge. Water is held back by the dam and released in a controlled way. This controls flooding.\nWater is usually stored in a reservoir behind the dam. This water can then be used to generate hydroelectric power or for recreation purposes.\nBuilding a dam can be very expensive.\nSediment is often trapped behind the wall of the dam, leading to erosion further downstream.\nSettlements and agricultural land may be lost when the river valley is flooded to form a reservoir.\nThe river channel may be widened or deepened allowing it to carry more water. A river channel may be straightened so that water can travel faster along the course. The channel course of the river can also be altered, diverting floodwaters away from settlements.\nAltering the river channel may lead to a greater risk of flooding downstream, as the water is carried there faster.\nTrees are planted near to the river. This means greater interception of rainwater and lower river discharge. This is a relatively low cost option, which enhances the environmental quality of the drainage basin.\nThe river is allowed to flood naturally in places, to prevent flooding in other areas - for example, near settlements.\nLocal authorities and the national government introduce policies to control urban development close to or on the floodplain. This reduces the chance of flooding and the risk of damage to property.\nThere can be resistance to development restrictions in areas where there is a shortage of housing. Enforcing planning regulations and controls may be harder in LEDCs.\nDifferent interest groups have different views about flood management techniques:\nGovernments and developers often favour large hard engineering options, such as dam building. Building a dam and a reservoir can generate income. Profits can be made from generating electric or leisure revenue.\nEnvironmental groups and local residents often prefer softer options, such as planting trees. Soft options cause little damage to the environment and do not involve the resettlement of communities.\nEffective flood management strategies should be economically, environmentally and socially sustainable.

{'text': "It is best way to start answering your question straight away. It will help you to focus on what is really important, and to decide what extra ideas you need as you develop your answer. So let's look at version two of 'What is the role of the Nurse in\n?' and see if we can tackle the question directly, without any waffle.\nWe first meet the Nurse in Act 1, Scene 3, as she talks to Lady Capulet and Juliet. The Nurse is quite different to the other characters: she seems very talkative and appears to ramble on. Her first topic of conversation is really Juliet's age - the Nurse explains in several different ways that Juliet is not quite 14 years old. Perhaps Shakespeare uses the Nurse here to show the audience just how innocent and young Juliet is. We also learn how close the Nurse is to Juliet. She remembers everything about Juliet's childhood and compares her to her dead daughter, Susan, who was born at the same time.\nThis might be your first attempt at starting the answer, but already it has a good focus on the question. The only time Shakespeare is mentioned is when we guess what he uses the character of the Nurse for, and this is an important point.

{'text': "Evolution has taken place over millions of years and is responsible for all the living things on Earth today. There are different views and theories about the origin of life and the evolutionary process.\nIt is not possible to be certain how life on Earth began.

The main theory is that living things developed from molecules that could\nThe material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.\nThere are two possible origins for these replicating molecules:\nthey were produced by the conditions on Earth at the time\nthey came from somewhere else, such as another planet in our Solar System, or further out in space\nOver many millions of years these molecules joined with other molecules, becoming gradually more complex and dependent on each other. The process of evolution by\neventually led to all of the different living things that we see on Earth today.\nCharles Darwin was an English naturalist who studied variation in plants and animals during a five-year voyage around the world in the 19th century. He explained his ideas on evolution in a book called, 'On the Origin of Species', published in 1859.\nDarwin’s ideas caused a lot of controversy, and this continues today, because they can be seen as\nabout the creation of the world and the creatures in it.\nThe basic idea behind the theory of evolution is that all the different species have evolved from simple life forms. These simple life forms first developed more than 3 billion years ago (the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old). The timeline below shows some of the key events in the evolution of life on Earth, from the first\nSingle-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants.

The key points are that:\nindividuals in a species show a wide range of variation\nthis variation is because of differences in their\nThe basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.\nindividuals with characteristics most suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce\nthe genes that allow these individuals to be successful are passed to their offspring\nIndividuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce. This means that their genes are less likely to be passed to the next generation. Given enough time, a species will gradually evolve.\ncan be caused by both genes and the environment. But it is only variation caused by genes that can be passed on to the next generation.\nLife on Earth today exists because of the conditions that were present when life was evolving. If, in the past, conditions had been different eg hotter, colder, or the Earth more or less massive, then evolution by natural selection could have produced some very different results. Our bodies would have changed to suit the Earth’s conditions.\nNatural selection and selective breeding can both produce changes in animals and plants. The difference between the two is that natural selection occurs in nature, but selective breeding only occurs when humans intervene.\nSelective breeding is a process where we choose the\nwe want in an animal. We then breed together a male and female that show some of those characteristics. From the offspring produced we select those that show the characteristic the most, and breed them together.\nThis process is repeated over many generations, each time selecting and breeding together those animals that have the characteristics we are looking for. Over a large number of generations, this can produce some surprising results.\nAll of these dogs were selectively bred from a common ancestor\nFarmers have used selective breeding for centuries to increase milk yield in cattle, produce larger eggs from chickens and obtain more grain from wheat.\nMutations are changes that can occur in\nThe basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.\n. These changes are random and can be caused by background radiation and chemicals that we come into contact with, for example the chemicals in cigarette smoke.\nSometimes these changes can be so severe that the\nBasic unit of life. Unicellular organisms only have one cell. Multicellular organisms have many cells.\ndies, sometimes the cell can divide uncontrollably and become cancerous, and sometimes the changes are small and the cell survives. Very rarely the changes may even be beneficial to us and produce new and useful characteristics.\nIf these changes occur in normal body cells, the changes are lost when we die. But if the changes occur in our\nsuch as sperm and ova, there is the possibility that the changes in the gene will be passed onto the next generation.\nIt is when these changes are passed on to the next generation that\ncan either ensure that they are selected if they are useful, or disappear from the gene pool if they are not.\nThe combined effect of these mutations, environmental changes, and natural selection, can sometimes produce changes in the organism that are so great that a new species is produced. This does not happen very often and only occurs when the mutated organism can no longer breed with the original species and is capable of producing fertile offspring.\nLiving organisms on Earth today, and the chemicals which work together to keep them alive, are extremely complex, even in single-celled micro-organisms. Some people find it hard to accept that such complexity could have evolved through natural selection. Some religious people believe that all living things on Earth were made by God, or that life was begun by God but then evolved through natural selection. We will probably never be absolutely certain about how life began, as no one was there to observe it. But scientists must base their theories on evidence.\nDarwin was not the only person to develop a theory of evolution. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a French scientist who developed an alternative theory at the beginning of the 19th century. His theory involved two ideas. These are:\nthe law of inheritance of acquired characteristics\nHis theory stated that a characteristic which is used more and more by an organism becomes bigger and stronger, and one that is not used eventually disappears. Any feature of an organism that is improved through use is passed to its offspring.\nThis table summarises the two different explanations for giraffes having long necks.\nSummary of explanations for giraffes having long necks\nA giraffe stretches its neck to reach food high up\nA giraffe with a longer neck can reach food high up\nThe giraffe’s neck gets longer because it is used a lot\nThe giraffe is more likely to get enough food to survive and to reproduce\nThe giraffe’s offspring inherit its long neck\nThe giraffe’s offspring inherit its long neck\nfor all the observations made about life on Earth. For instance, his theory would predict that all organisms gradually become complex, and simple organisms disappear.\nDarwin’s theory can account for the continued presence of simple organisms.\nJust like Darwin and Lamarck, when presented with information about alternative views about the origin of life and the evolutionary process, you need to be able to:\nIdentify statements that are data and statements that offer an explanation. For example, data is produced from an investigation and often but not always includes numbers. However, an explanation is a hypothesis that can be used to explain the data. If a scientist grows a micro-organism and counts the number of micro-organisms present every thirty minutes, the numbers he or she collects is\n. If the scientist notices that the number doubles every thirty minutes, he or she can use the data to produce an explanation, eg that\nSingle-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium.\ndivide every thirty minutes and the numbers increase exponentially.\nRecognise data or observations that are accounted for, or conflict with, an\nhardened remains or impressions of an organism that existed in the geological past\ncan be dated by looking at the age of the rock in which they are found. The fossil record shows how organisms have changed over a period of time. The data supports the explanation of the theory of evolution. However, when the fossil data is compared with the theory that all life on Earth started just a few thousand years ago, the data does not support the explanation.\nin an explanation. For example, sometimes the data collected from an investigation does not immediately lead to an explanation. When Alexander Fleming noticed that bacteria were not growing next to the penicillium mould it took imagination and creativity for him to think that maybe the mould was producing a chemical that was killing the bacteria. That is how antibiotics were discovered.\nIdentify a scientific question for which there is not an agreed answer. For example, did life evolve on planet Earth or did it arrive on a meteorite from outer space? Because no one was there at the time it is impossible to give an exact answer.\nSuggest why scientists involved in the same research sometimes disagree with each other. For example, many years ago, when scientists were first trying to date how old a fossil was, they sometimes disagreed. It was only when more evidence became available that they began to agree on the fossil’s age.\nYou will also need to be able to suggest why some scientists are reluctant to change their minds and explanations, even when new evidence is found that contradicts them. This is often due to the fact that scientists devote their lives to their research. To realise that, after all the years they have spent on it, their theory was wrong, is very difficult to accept.\nFossils of ammonites - sea creatures that became extinct about 65 million years ago\nMost of the evidence for evolution comes from the\n. Fossils show how much, or how little, organisms have changed over time.\nOne of the problems with the fossil record is that it contains gaps. Not all organisms fossilise well. And many fossils are destroyed by the movements of the Earth, or have simply not been discovered.\nEvolution is difficult to observe because it usually occurs over many years. This is one reason why the theory of evolution is\n, not a law. Since no one was around millions of years ago to make observations, take notes or carry out experiments, evolution cannot be proven in the usual scientific sense. However, rapid changes in species have been observed that support the theory.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution in Britain, most peppered moths were of the pale variety. They were camouflaged against the pale birch trees they rested on. Moths with a mutant black colouring were spotted easily by birds and eaten. This gave the white variety an advantage, making them more likely to survive and reproduce.\nAirborne pollution in industrial areas blackened the birch tree bark with soot. This meant the mutant black moths were now camouflaged, while the white variety became more vulnerable to predators. It gave the black variety an advantage. They were then more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the black peppered moths became far more numerous in urban areas than the pale variety.\nThe pale peppered moths camouflage well against the pale birch tree\nThe darker mutant peppered moths camouflage well against the blackened birch tree\nE. coli bacteria (Photo from Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, NIH)\nSingle-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium.\nultramicroscopic non-cellular organisms that replicate themselves inside the cells of living hosts\nreproduce rapidly and can evolve in a relatively short time. One example is the bacterium E. coli. Its\nThe material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information.

But occasionally the mutation is beneficial (to the bacteria). For example, it may allow resistance to certain\nSubstances that kill bacteria and fungal infections.\n. When those antibiotics are present, the resistant bacteria have an advantage over the bacteria that are not resistant. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are an increasing problem in hospitals.\nScientists can now examine the DNA from different species of organism and use the data produced to see how closely related the two species are to each other. By collecting a lot of this data, scientists can compare the results with conventional ideas about how organisms have evolved. What they found was that DNA data supported the conventional theory of evolution.\nYou need to be able to provide an explanation that links together things that were previously thought to be unrelated. For example, DNA data being used to support the theory of evolution. Also people had noticed that there was a wide variety of different things living on the planet. Darwin noticed that different islands in the Galapagos had different types of finches adapted to eating the type of food found on each island. It was only when Darwin produced his theory of evolution by natural selection that these two unrelated facts were linked together.\nLiving organisms are dependent on the environment and other species for their survival. When the environment changes, organisms are not as well adapted to it.\nIndividuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will become\nspecies of organism that is no longer living\nHere are some factors that can cause a species to become extinct:\nrapid changes to the environment, such as the climate\nBecause we are all part of a\n, changes in one part of the web can have a big impact on other parts of the web. When one food source disappears, a predator will have to find another food source in order to survive.\nThe fossil record shows that since life on Earth began many species have become\n. Extinction is still occurring, a lot of it because of human activity. We compete with other living things for space, food and water, and are very successful predators.\nSome animals such as the quagga are extinct because of the\nThe last quagga alive in the wild was shot in the late 1870s.\nThe quagga was the first extinct species to have its\nThe material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.\nstudied. The DNA showed that the quagga was not a separate species as had been previously thought, but was a type of zebra.\nThe DNA result from the quagga is a good example of where new data is in conflict with a previous explanation.\nOther animals such as the dodo are extinct because of the\n. The dodo was a large flightless bird that lived in the Mauritius, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean. These islands were uninhabited, and the dodo had no natural predators. Then Mauritius were colonised by the Dutch in 1638. Dodos were hunted for food and easy to catch, because they were not afraid of people. However, it was new competitors brought to the islands, such as pigs, cats and rats, which ate the dodos' eggs and young, that were finally responsible for the extinction of the dodo.\nBiodiversity means having as wide a range of different species as possible. Maintaining biodiversity is an important part of using the environment in a\nway. Indiscriminate use of the environment, for example cutting down large areas of the rain forest to grow crops such as soya, results in a large number of species becoming extinct and reduces biodiversity.\nIt is only now that we are beginning to realise the potential medicines and crops that we can obtain from a wide range of different organisms. Only by maintaining biodiversity can we be sure that these benefits will be available for future generations.\n", 'label': '5'}

For example, one player might play the music faster, or might play using different dynamics or phrasing.\nNo two performers play music in the same way, because each performer interprets the music differently.

Listen to these two pieces which employ the same melody: first\nby Sweetbox. See if you can identify 3 features the pieces have in common (apart from the tune!) and 3 contrasting features.\nThe kind of features you should have noticed:\ntempo in second piece is quicker than the first- the first is largo, the second more upbeat\nTonality change - first minor, second major\nViolins plays melody / legato / smoothly\nInstrumentation different - second added voices and drum kit\nIf you are describing sung music, you need to be able to name the type of singing voice.

In the first version a string ensemble enters and then the violin solo part takes over the melody. The solo violin is playing fast semi-quaver passages in separate bows. In the second version a solo pianist performs all parts, interweaving the separate parts between left and right hand. In the first version a flute enters to play an answering melodic phrase. Thus, although both version are allegro, and demonstrate the same dynamic ranges. However the orchestration changes as the first is arranged for a solo violin with string and flute backing. The second is arranged solely for piano.\nBoth versions are examples of the same tune but are played by different instruments. Both are fast. In the first example there is a solo violin and in the second a solo piano part. The first version is accompanied whereas the second is not.\nBoth versions play the same song but are played on different instruments. The speed is the same in both.\n", 'label': '5'}

These are\nYou may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.\nThis happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.\nWhen we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.\nThis is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.\nAstronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.\nScientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.\nA satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.\nA summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation\nThe light from other galaxies is red-shifted.\nThe other galaxies are moving away from us.\nThe further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.\nThe most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding.

A perch can be the branch on which a bird rests, or (more colloquially) a place to rest - or a fish.\nThe river appears to be very beautiful - the water is\n(line 1) and tree-lined, and Heaney refers to its\nin line 4 (a body or solid mass of water - but with suggestions also of a human body, \'glorified\' by the dappling sunlight).\nThe fish are the same today as they were when Heaney was a child -\n(line 4). Seeing the fish triggers off memories of childhood and makes him think about everything that changes in the world.\nWe see things not just through the poet\'s eyes, but through the fishes\' own eyes too:\n(line 6) is how they see the surface of the river.\nThe poem ends by describing the perch\n"on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world."\nagainst the changing world that flows around them. To Heaney the perch seem to represent things that resist change: they stay still in the water and they are still the same as they were when he was a child.

Either way, it really may appear that the perch are \'perching\' in the branches.\nHeaney and his friends called the perch\n(line 3) as children.

Should this poem be read:\nin a lively, energetic way, to reflect the movement of the water?\nin a slow, thoughtful way, to reflect the apparent stillness of the fish?\nWell, the poem celebrates both these things - fluidity\nstillness. So either or even (if possible) both these tones of voice would be appropriate!\nAn important idea in this poem (apart from the detailed, powerful description of the perch in the river) is the relationship between permanence and change. Heaney uses the flowing river-water and the stationary fish as a\nA description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using \'as\' or \'like\'. \'Sea of troubles\', and \'drowning in debt\' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.\nfor this relationship. Have a look at the following quotes, and at our suggestions as to how they fit into this idea.\nI saw and I see in the river\'s glorified body..\nHeaney praises the river. He sees it as glorified, a powerful word in\nA description of all the differences between two things (in this case, two texts).\nto the starker language he uses elsewhere in the poem, which suggests his love of the river - perhaps even a religious attitude towards it.\nHeaney seems fond of the perch.

Adoze suggests they are sleeping as they swim, while Guzzling is an affectionate word, sometimes used to describe babies drinking.\non hold / In the everything goes and steady go of the world\nThe world is described in terms of water, flowing on. This suggests that Heaney sees things as always moving and changing. The fish are \'on hold\', but they are not fighting the current so much as drinking it, letting it pass through and around them. Perhaps Heaney is suggesting that this is the only kind of permanence that is possible or desirable...\nIn the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare\n? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!\nA description of the similarities and differences between two things (in this case, two texts).\nBoth poems describe a living creature in its natural environment, and use this as a\nAn image or thing (usually something physical, like a flag) that stands for or represents something else - usually something abstract, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.\nBut in Clarke\'s poem the mouse is a symbol of vulnerability and impermanence; while in Heaney\'s the perch represents a kind of permanence and strength.\nBoth poems celebrate a favourite waterside scene and the life of creatures within it\nPairs of lines of poetry that rhyme and have the same length and metric pattern.\nMarks used in written texts to divide them up into phrases, clauses and sentences, show speech etc, and to clarify meaning.\nto emphasise the \'flow\' of the words\nBoth describe an animal in its natural habitat, and both try to see the world from the animal\'s own viewpoint\nBoth poems emphasise the strength of the creature, and how well it is adapted to its way of life.\nIn the exam you\'ll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.\nWhen you are asked to compare poems, it\'s a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:\nsubject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone\nCompare Perch with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that focus on creatures (animals, birds and fish) in the wild. What is the poet\'s attitude in each poem?\nThree poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark\'s Field Mouse, John Clare\'s Sonnet, and Alfred Tennyson\'s The Eagle.\nWhat would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Perch with each of these three poems.\nThe title of each poem shows the importance of the Field Mouse and the Perch: as we read, we realise that each is a symbol.\nThe field mouse is a symbol of all things vulnerable to outside attack, while the perch are a symbol of the few things that remain unchanged in today\'s world.\nClarke emphasises how weak the field mouse is in contrast to man, but Heaney sees the fish as independent and unaffected by man.\nSo, Field Mouse has a threatening tone, whereas Perch has a lighter, warmer tone.\nBoth poems celebrate a favourite waterside scene containing trees and wildlife. Clare writes entirely from his point of view, but Heaney manages to show things from his perspective and the perspective of the perch.\nBoth are written in rhyming couplets. Clare uses no punctuation at all and Heaney uses punctuation sparingly so as not to interrupt the flow of the poem.\nThe scene in Sonnet is very relaxed, with gentle descriptions of the Moor Hen and insects that sport, but Heaney suggests the strength of the perch too, all muscle and slur.\nAgain, the title shows the focus of the poems. Tennyson is more precise: he is writing about The Eagle, rather than Perch in general.\nBoth poets show us the creature\'s point of view. The Eagle, from his high crag, sees the wrinkled sea beneath him, while the perch see the water-roof above them.\nBoth creatures are utterly at home in their sphere. This is shown humorously by Heaney - carpets of Bann stream - and majestically by Tennyson - Ring\'d with the azure world, he stands.\nBoth show the power of the creature: Heaney uses military imagery, bluntly holding the pass, while for Tennyson the eagle is like a thunderbolt.\nOf course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.\n', 'label': '5'}

Fossils show how much, or how little, organisms have changed over time.\nOne of the problems with the fossil record is that it contains gaps. Not all organisms fossilise well. And many fossils are destroyed by the movements of the Earth, or have simply not been discovered.\nEvolution is difficult to observe because it usually occurs over many years. This is one reason why the theory of evolution is\n, not a law. Since no one was around millions of years ago to make observations, take notes or carry out experiments, evolution cannot be proven in the usual scientific sense. However, rapid changes in species have been observed that support the theory.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution in Britain, most peppered moths were of the pale variety. They were camouflaged against the pale birch trees they rested on. Moths with a mutant black colouring were spotted easily by birds and eaten. This gave the white variety an advantage, making them more likely to survive and reproduce.\nAirborne pollution in industrial areas blackened the birch tree bark with soot. This meant the mutant black moths were now camouflaged, while the white variety became more vulnerable to predators. It gave the black variety an advantage. They were then more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the black peppered moths became far more numerous in urban areas than the pale variety.\nThe pale peppered moths camouflage well against the pale birch tree\nThe darker mutant peppered moths camouflage well against the blackened birch tree\nE. coli bacteria (Photo from Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, NIH)\nSingle-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants.

But occasionally the mutation is beneficial (to the bacteria). For example, it may allow resistance to certain\nSubstances that kill bacteria and fungal infections.\n. When those antibiotics are present, the resistant bacteria have an advantage over the bacteria that are not resistant. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are an increasing problem in hospitals.\nScientists can now examine the DNA from different species of organism and use the data produced to see how closely related the two species are to each other. By collecting a lot of this data, scientists can compare the results with conventional ideas about how organisms have evolved. What they found was that DNA data supported the conventional theory of evolution.\nYou need to be able to provide an explanation that links together things that were previously thought to be unrelated. For example, DNA data being used to support the theory of evolution. Also people had noticed that there was a wide variety of different things living on the planet. Darwin noticed that different islands in the Galapagos had different types of finches adapted to eating the type of food found on each island.

The exterior angle (120°) is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles (70° + a).\nTherefore, 70° + a = 120°, so a = 50°.\nb = 60°, because the angles on a straight line add up to 180°.\nb + 120° = 180°, so b = 60°.\nThe angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360º.

It has 1 line of symmetry. It has no rotational symmetry.\nDo not be too alarmed by all these facts - you probably know most of them already!\nThe simplest polygon is a triangle (a 3-sided shape). Polygons of all types can be regular or irregular.\nA regular polygon has sides of equal length, and all its interior angles are of equal size.\nIrregular polygons can have sides of any length and angles of any size.\nHere are the names of some common polygons:\nCan you give the name of a regular triangle?\ntriangle because all of its sides are of equal length, and all its interior angles are the same size (60°).\nCan you give the name of a regular quadrilateral?\nRemember that a rectangle is not a regular quadrilateral, because not all of its sides are of equal length.\nWe have seen that regular triangles and regular quadrilaterals have special names. In fact, they are the only polygons which do. All other regular polygons are simply termed 'regular pentagon', 'regular hexagon' etc.\nIn your exam, you might be asked to find angles of polygons.\nThe formula for calculating the sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is:\nis the number of sides of the polygon.\nThis formula comes from dividing the polygon up into triangles using full diagonals.\nWe already know that the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180°. For any polygon, count up how many triangles it can be split into. Then multiply the number of triangles by 180.\nThis quadrilateral has been divided into two triangles, so the interior angles add up to 2 × 180 = 360°.\nThis pentagon has been divided into three triangles, so the interior angles add up to 3 × 180 = 540°.\nIn the same way, a hexagon can be divided into 4 triangles, a 7-sided polygon into 5 triangles etc.\nCan you see the pattern forming? The number of triangles is equal to the number of sides minus 2.\nWhat is the sum of the interior angles of an octagon?\nYou calculate 6 × 180 = 1080°.\nRemember that the formula for the sum of interior angles is (n - 2) × 180.

So n = 8, and n - 2 = 6.\nIf you find it difficult to remember formulas, just add 180° each time in the following way:\nThe exterior angle of a polygon and its corresponding interior angle always add up to 180° (because they make a straight line).\nFor any polygon, the sum of its exterior angles is 360°.\n(You can see this because if you imagine 'walking' all the way round the outside of a polygon you make one full turn.)\nCalculating the interior and exterior angles of regular polygons\nWe already know how to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon using the formula\nWe also know that all the interior angles of a regular polygon are equal.\nInterior angle of a regular polygon = sum of interior angles ÷ number of sides\nFind the interior angle of a regular hexagon.\nWe know from the formula that the interior angles of a hexagon add up to 720°.\nAs a hexagon has six sides, each angle is equal to\nWe know that the exterior angles of a regular polygon\nadd up to 360°, so the exterior angle of a regular hexagon is\nThe interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle always add up to 180°.

Calculate the number of sides.\nThe interior angles are 120°, so the exterior angles are 180° - 120° = 60°. The exterior angles add up to 360°, so if we divide 360° by 60° we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are\nThe interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150°.
